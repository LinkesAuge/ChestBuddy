# Correction System Conversation Summary

## Core Requirements

### Cell State Management
- Implement a dedicated TableStateManager for handling cell states
- Integrate TableStateManager as a property of DataView
- Handle batch processing with fixed size of 100 rows
- Ensure non-blocking UI updates during processing

### Progress Display
- Show overall progress bar for operations
- Display detailed correction log
- Include correction overview with:
  - Original value
  - Corrected value
  - Correction type
  - Total amount of corrections

### Error Handling
- Continue processing on non-critical errors
- Display error summary at completion
- Log all errors appropriately
- Define critical errors as those preventing data reading/writing

### Validation and Correction
- Keep validation and correction as independent processes
- Consider active corrections during validation
- Run auto-validation before auto-correction when both enabled
- Update affected cells/rows on edits

## Implementation Details

### TableStateManager
- Manage cell states
- Track validation history
- Handle targeted updates
- Integrate with validation and correction systems

### Progress Dialog
- Display overall progress
- Show current operation status
- Include expandable correction details
- Present error summary upon completion

### Integration Points
- DataView integration
- ValidationService integration
- CorrectionService integration
- Import/Export system integration

## Technical Decisions
- Fixed batch size: 100 rows
- No cancellation option for initial implementation
- Single progress bar with detailed log
- Error aggregation with end-of-process summary

## Future Considerations
- Potential implementation of cancellation functionality
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Extended correction logging capabilities
