# DataView Refactoring - Project Overview

## Introduction and Background

The DataView component is a central element of the ChestBuddy application, responsible for displaying, validating, and allowing interaction with chest data. As the application has evolved, the current implementation of the DataView has shown limitations in handling validation statuses, providing effective user interaction through context menus, and supporting advanced data manipulation features. This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the DataView component to address these issues and provide a more robust, maintainable, and feature-rich implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture

The current DataView implementation follows a Model-View-Adapter pattern, where:

- **ChestDataModel**: Serves as the central data model, containing the raw data and providing access methods.
- **DataView**: A PySide6.QTableView subclass that displays the data.
- **DataViewAdapter**: Connects the ChestDataModel to the DataView, handling data transformation and presentation.
- **TableStateManager**: Manages the visual state of cells (normal, invalid, correctable) based on validation results.

The system also integrates with:

- **ValidationService**: Validates data and provides validation status information.
- **CorrectionService**: Handles data corrections based on predefined rules.

### Identified Issues

The current implementation suffers from several key issues:

1. **Validation Status Display**:
   - Inconsistent display of validation statuses in the UI
   - Issues with mapping validation results to visual cell states
   - Lack of clear visual indicators for different validation status types

2. **Context Menu Functionality**:
   - Limited support for context-specific actions
   - Inefficient handling of multi-selection operations
   - Missing integration with correction and validation workflows

3. **Data Interaction**:
   - No support for bulk operations
   - Limited copy/paste functionality
   - Inefficient cell editing workflow

4. **Architecture and Performance**:
   - Tight coupling between components
   - Performance issues with large datasets
   - Code duplication and lack of clear boundaries

5. **Integration Issues**:
   - Inconsistent signal-slot connections
   - Unclear ownership of state management
   - Synchronization issues between data model and view

## Goals and Requirements

## Proposed Architecture

### Architecture Principles

The refactored DataView will follow these architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data management, presentation, and business logic.
2. **Composability**: Components that can be composed to build more complex functionality.
3. **Testability**: Design that facilitates comprehensive testing.
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one primary responsibility.
5. **Open/Closed**: Components open for extension but closed for modification.

### Component Overview

The new architecture will consist of the following key components:

#### Data Layer
- **ChestDataModel**: Central data repository (existing)
- **DataViewModel**: Model adapter for the view, providing data access, sorting, filtering

#### Presentation Layer
- **DataTableView**: Core table view component for displaying data
- **DataHeaderView**: Column header component with enhanced functionality
- **DataCellRenderer**: Custom cell renderers for different data types and states

#### Interaction Layer
- **DataContextMenu**: Context menu with dynamic content based on selection
- **DataViewToolbar**: Toolbar with actions for data manipulation
- **DataFilterPanel**: UI for filtering and searching data

#### State Management
- **TableStateManager**: Enhanced version for managing cell visual states
- **SelectionManager**: Handling selection state and operations
- **ValidationStateAdapter**: Connect validation results to visual representation

#### Services Integration
- **ValidationAdapter**: Connect to ValidationService
- **CorrectionAdapter**: Connect to CorrectionService
- **ImportExportAdapter**: Connect to import/export functionality

### Signal-Slot Connections

The components will communicate primarily through signals and slots, following these patterns:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - ChestDataModel -> DataViewModel -> DataTableView
   - Changes propagate through change signals

2. **State Management**:
   - ValidationService -> ValidationStateAdapter -> TableStateManager
   - TableStateManager -> DataCellRenderer

3. **User Interaction**:
   - DataTableView -> SelectionManager
   - DataContextMenu -> Service Adapters

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Core DataView Implementation**
   - Establish new folder structure
   - Implement base classes (DataViewModel, DataTableView)
   - Add core functionality (data loading, selection, columns)

2. **Phase 2: Context Menu Implementation**
   - Design context menu architecture
   - Implement standard actions
   - Add advanced functionality

3. **Phase 3: Validation and Correction Integration**
   - Implement validation status display
   - Connect to correction system
   - Add inline correction suggestions

4. **Phase 4: Import/Export and Advanced Features**
   - Implement import/export
   - Add search and filter
   - Optimize performance

### Technology Stack

The refactored DataView will use:

- **PySide6**: Core UI framework
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Qt Signal/Slot**: Communication mechanism
- **pytest**: Testing framework

### Development Practices

The development will follow these practices:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests first, implementation second
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on each commit
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed by team members
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of components and interfaces

## Conclusion

The DataView refactoring project aims to address the current limitations of the component while providing a more robust, maintainable, and feature-rich implementation. By following a structured approach and focusing on clear architectural boundaries, the refactored DataView will better serve the needs of the ChestBuddy application and its users.
