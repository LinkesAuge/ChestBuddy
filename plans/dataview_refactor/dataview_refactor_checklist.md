## Testing Guidelines

For each implementation phase, ensure:

1. Unit tests are created before or alongside implementation
2. Integration tests verify component interaction
3. UI tests confirm visual correctness and user experience
4. Performance tests validate efficiency with large datasets

Refer to the detailed [testing strategy documents](testing/) for specific test approaches:
- [Unit Tests](testing/unit_tests.md)
- [Integration Tests](testing/integration_tests.md)  
- [UI Tests](testing/ui_tests.md)
- [Performance Tests](testing/performance_tests.md)

## Implementation Progress

| Phase | Status | Completion % | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 1. Documentation | In Progress | 90% | Most documents created |
| 2. Core Architecture | Not Started | 0% | - |
| 3. Validation/Correction | Not Started | 0% | - |
| 4. Context Menu | Not Started | 0% | - |
| 5. Performance | Not Started | 0% | - |
