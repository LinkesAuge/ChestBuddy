# DataView Refactoring - Master Checklist

## Project Overview
This document serves as the central tracking checklist for the comprehensive refactoring of the DataView component in ChestBuddy. The refactoring aims to address the issues with validation status display, improve the context menu functionality, and enhance the overall performance and maintainability of the data view.
