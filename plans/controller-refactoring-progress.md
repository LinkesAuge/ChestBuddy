# Controller Refactoring Progress

## Phase 4: Controller Integration with SignalManager

Completed integration of SignalManager with controllers for improved signal connection management:

### Completed Tasks

1. Created a `BaseController` class with the following features:
   - SignalManager integration
   - Standardized methods for connecting to models and views
   - Tracking of connected views and models
   - Connection cleanup methods
   - Automatic cleanup on controller deletion

2. Updated all controllers to inherit from `BaseController`:
   - `DataViewController` 
   - `ViewStateController`
   - `ProgressController`
   - `FileOperationsController`
   - `ErrorHandlingController`
   - `UIStateController`

3. Modified all controller constructors to:
   - Accept a `signal_manager` parameter
   - Pass the signal manager to the BaseController constructor
   - Use the signal_manager for all signal connections

4. Fixed test cases to work with the new BaseController pattern:
   - Added SignalManager to test fixtures
   - Created proper mock signals in test classes
   - Updated attribute names in tests to match new implementation

5. Updated the `ChestBuddyApp` class to:
   - Pass SignalManager to all controllers during initialization
   - Properly initialize the controller hierarchy

### Testing Status

- BaseController tests: ✅ All passing
- Signal integration tests: ✅ All passing
- Controller-specific tests: ⚠️ Some tests require QApplication (GUI tests)
- App integration tests: ✅ Application runs successfully

### Known Issues

1. Some GUI-dependent tests fail when run without a QApplication
2. Minor warnings about disconnection during application shutdown
3. ViewStateController has a bug with `is_empty()` vs `is_empty` (bool vs function)

### Next Steps

1. Fix ViewStateController bug with is_empty check
2. Update Qt-dependent tests to use pytest-qt fixture
3. Complete documentation for BaseController usage
4. Add more comprehensive test coverage for controller cleanup
