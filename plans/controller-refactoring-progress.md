# Controller Refactoring Progress

## SignalManager Integration

**Status: COMPLETED**

We have successfully created a BaseController class that:
1. Inherits from QObject
2. Takes a SignalManager instance in its constructor
3. Provides standardized methods for connecting to models and views
4. Tracks connected models and views
5. Automatically disconnects signals in its destructor

All controllers have been updated to inherit from the BaseController and properly manage their signal connections:
1. FileOperationsController
2. ProgressController
3. ErrorHandlingController
4. ViewStateController
5. DataViewController
6. UIStateController

Additionally, we have:
1. Implemented SignalManager's safe_connect method for reliable signal connections
2. Added blocked_signals context manager for temporary signal blocking
3. Implemented type checking for signal/slot compatibility
4. Added support for prioritized connections
5. Enhanced parameter counting logic for bound methods and default parameters

All tests are now passing, with improved signal management and connection safety.

## Phase 4: Controller Integration with SignalManager

Completed integration of SignalManager with controllers for improved signal connection management:

### Completed Tasks

1. Created a `BaseController` class with the following features:
   - SignalManager integration
   - Standardized methods for connecting to models and views
   - Tracking of connected views and models
   - Connection cleanup methods
   - Automatic cleanup on controller deletion

2. Updated all controllers to inherit from `BaseController`:
   - `DataViewController` 
   - `ViewStateController`
   - `ProgressController`
   - `FileOperationsController`
   - `ErrorHandlingController`
   - `UIStateController`

3. Modified all controller constructors to:
   - Accept a `signal_manager` parameter
   - Pass the signal manager to the BaseController constructor
   - Use the signal_manager for all signal connections

4. Fixed test cases to work with the new BaseController pattern:
   - Added SignalManager to test fixtures
   - Created proper mock signals in test classes
   - Updated attribute names in tests to match new implementation

5. Updated the `ChestBuddyApp` class to:
   - Pass SignalManager to all controllers during initialization
   - Properly initialize the controller hierarchy

### Testing Status

- BaseController tests: ✅ All passing
- Signal integration tests: ✅ All passing
- Controller-specific tests: ⚠️ Some tests require QApplication (GUI tests)
- App integration tests: ✅ Application runs successfully

### Known Issues

1. Some GUI-dependent tests fail when run without a QApplication
2. Minor warnings about disconnection during application shutdown
3. ViewStateController has a bug with `is_empty()` vs `is_empty` (bool vs function)

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix ViewStateController bug with is_empty check
2. ✅ Update Qt-dependent tests to use pytest-qt fixture
3. ✅ Complete documentation for BaseController usage
4. ✅ Add more comprehensive test coverage for controller cleanup

## Phase 5: Signal Throttling Implementation

Completed implementation of signal throttling capabilities to improve UI performance with rapidly firing signals:

### Completed Tasks

1. Enhanced SignalManager with throttling capabilities:
   - Added both throttle and debounce modes
   - Implemented proper tracking of throttled connections
   - Created comprehensive error handling for throttling
   - Added debug support for throttled connections

2. Created comprehensive test suite for throttling functionality:
   - Tests for different throttling modes (throttle vs debounce)
   - Tests for rapid emission scenarios
   - Tests for disconnection of throttled signals
   - Integration with existing connection tracking

3. Documented throttling functionality:
   - Added detailed docstrings for all new methods
   - Created usage examples for different throttling scenarios
   - Documented performance considerations for throttling

## Phase 6: Signal Connection Safety Enhancements

Completed implementation of signal connection safety enhancements to improve robustness and maintainability:

### Completed Tasks

1. Implemented prioritized signal connections:
   - Added support for connection priorities with multiple levels
   - Implemented sorting of connections based on priority
   - Created mechanism to ensure execution order follows priority
   - Added constants for common priority levels (HIGHEST, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, LOWEST)

2. Added signal-slot type compatibility checking:
   - Implemented parameter counting for signals and slots
   - Added compatibility verification before connections are made
   - Created special handling for bound methods
   - Added support for default parameters and variadic arguments

3. Created utility methods for connection tracking:
   - Implemented has_connection method for connection checking
   - Added get_connection_count for tracking total connections
   - Enhanced debugging capabilities for connection tracking

4. Created comprehensive test suite for safety enhancements:
   - Tests for prioritized connections and execution order
   - Tests for compatibility checking with various scenarios
   - Tests for utility methods and connection tracking
   - Edge case handling for complex signal-slot combinations

### Testing Status

- Prioritized connection tests: ✅ All passing
- Type compatibility tests: ✅ All passing
- Connection tracking utility tests: ✅ All passing
- Integration tests: ✅ All passing

### Next Steps

All planned signal connection management improvements have been completed. Next focus areas:

1. Enhanced Debugging Tools for Signal Flow Visualization
2. UI Update Interface Standardization
3. Data State Tracking Implementation
