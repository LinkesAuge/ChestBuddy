## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for implementation is:

1. Controller Interfaces → BaseController → Concrete Controllers → ControllerFactory
2. Task Interface → BaseTask → TaskManager → TaskFactory
3. Application Integration (depends on both paths above)

Other improvements can be developed in parallel:

- SignalManager can be implemented independently
- IUpdatable and UpdateManager can be developed separately
- DataState and state tracking can be implemented without blocking other work

## Incremental Testing Strategy

Each phase should include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **Regression Tests**: Ensuring existing functionality works correctly
4. **Performance Tests**: Verifying performance is maintained or improved

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Controller Architecture Refactoring**: Affects core application structure
   - Mitigation: Implement incrementally with thorough testing after each step
   - Fallback: Can maintain hybrid approach if issues arise

2. **Thread Management Improvements**: Critical for application stability
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with various task types and cancellation scenarios
   - Fallback: Maintain old BackgroundWorker alongside new TaskManager temporarily

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Signal Connection Management**: COMPLETED
   - Implemented SignalManager utility for centralized connection management
   - Added throttling capabilities with throttle and debounce modes
   - Added prioritized connections for controlling execution order
   - Implemented type checking for signal-slot compatibility
   - Added utilities for connection tracking

2. **Data State Tracking**: Affects data change detection
   - Mitigation: Dual tracking during transition
   - Fallback: Can keep old hash-based system if issues arise

### Low-Risk Areas
1. **UI Update Interface**: Less critical for core functionality
   - Mitigation: Implement gradually, one component at a time
   - Fallback: Can maintain direct update calls if needed

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics
- Reduced code complexity (measured by cyclomatic complexity)
- Increased test coverage
- Reduced duplication (measured by code clone analysis)
- Improved maintainability index

### Performance Metrics
- Equivalent or improved CPU usage
- Reduced memory usage
- Equivalent or improved UI responsiveness
- Faster background task execution

### Developer Experience Metrics

## Post-Implementation Review

After implementing all improvements, conduct a review to:
1. Evaluate success against metrics
2. Identify any remaining redundancies
3. Document lessons learned
4. Plan for further optimizations
