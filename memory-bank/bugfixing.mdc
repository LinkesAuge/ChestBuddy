# Bug Tracking and Resolution

This document tracks bugs, issues, and their resolutions in the ChestBuddy project.

## Active Issues

None identified yet as the project is in the initial setup phase.

## Resolved Issues

None yet as implementation has not started.

## Common Challenges

### Character Encoding
- **Issue**: German umlauts (ä, ö, ü, ß) often have encoding issues when processing CSV files
- **Solution**: Will implement special handling using ftfy, charset-normalizer, and unidecode libraries

### Performance with Large Datasets
- **Issue**: Potential performance challenges with large CSV files (10,000+ rows)
- **Solution**: Will implement efficient data structures and background processing

## Error Handling Strategy

1. Use clear and specific exception types
2. Implement comprehensive logging
3. Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI
4. Include context information for debugging
5. Use try-except blocks for all file operations

## Debugging Notes

This section will be updated as development progresses and specific debugging techniques are identified for common issues.
