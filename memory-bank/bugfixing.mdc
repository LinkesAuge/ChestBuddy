- **Fix:** Updated set_files and _on_clear_all methods to explicitly show the empty state widget

#### WelcomeStateWidget checkbox signal issue (2025-03-26)
- **Issue:** "Don't show again" checkbox signal emitting incorrect values
- **Cause:** The signal emission was checking for Qt.Checked instead of the actual state value
- **Fix:** Updated _on_dont_show_changed method to check the actual state value (2 for checked)

#### Missing color constants in style.py (2025-03-26)
- **Issue:** Tests failing due to missing DISABLED color constant
- **Cause:** Color constant not defined in the style resources
- **Fix:** Added the DISABLED color constant to chestbuddy/ui/resources/style.py

#### UI State tests metaclass conflict (2025-03-26)
- **Issue:** Tests for MainWindow UI State failing due to metaclass conflicts
- **Cause:** Trying to use real MainWindow class in tests which has multiple inheritance with QMainWindow
- **Fix:** Created MainWindowMock class to avoid metaclass conflicts in tests

#### MainWindow UI State tests not properly mocking BlockableProgressDialog (2025-03-26)

<<<<<<< HEAD
- ðŸ”„ UI still blocked after first import (UI State Management System Implementation)
  - **Issue**: Despite multiple incremental fix attempts, the UI blocking issue after the first import persists.
  - **Cause**: Root analysis shows our approach of reactive patching has fundamental flaws. The real problems are:
    1. Lack of centralized UI state management
    2. Ad-hoc implementation of UI blocking/unblocking
    3. Reliance on timing and delayed checks (inherently fragile)
    4. No proper reference counting for blocking operations
    5. Mixed responsibilities in code (UI state mixed with business logic)
  - **Solution Approach**: Complete architectural redesign with a `UIStateManager` system that provides:
    1. Centralized tracking of which UI elements are blocked and why
    2. Reference counting for multiple operations blocking the same element
    3. Context manager for operations that might block the UI
    4. Proper element state tracking and restoration
    5. Thread-safe implementation for cross-thread operations
    6. Clear separation of UI state from business logic
  - **Implementation Status**:
    - Core components implemented
    - Tests written and passed
    - Example implementations created
    - Integration in progress
    - Phased implementation plan defined

- âœ… RecentFilesList test failures
  - **Issue**: Tests for the RecentFilesList component were failing due to visibility issues with the EmptyStateWidget
  - **Cause**: The EmptyStateWidget was not being properly shown when there were no files in the list
  - **Fix**: Updated the set_files and _on_clear_all methods to explicitly call show() on the empty state widget, and updated tests to check properties rather than just visibility
  - **Date**: 2025-03-26

- âœ… WelcomeStateWidget checkbox signal issue
  - **Issue**: The dont_show_again_changed signal in WelcomeStateWidget was not emitting correct values
  - **Cause**: The signal handler was checking for Qt.Checked (which may have different values in different environments) rather than checking for the actual state value
  - **Fix**: Modified the _on_dont_show_changed method to explicitly check for state == 2 (the value when checked) rather than comparing to Qt.Checked
  - **Date**: 2025-03-26

- âœ… Missing color constants in style.py
  - **Issue**: Some tests were failing due to missing DISABLED color constant in the Colors class
  - **Cause**: The DISABLED color was being referenced in tests and components but wasn't defined in the Colors class
  - **Fix**: Added the DISABLED color constant to the Colors class in style.py
  - **Date**: 2025-03-26

- âœ… UI State tests metaclass conflict
  - **Issue**: Tests for the UI State Management System were failing due to metaclass conflicts when importing MainWindow
  - **Cause**: The MainWindow class now uses the BlockableElementMixin which has a metaclass, causing conflicts when multiple inheritance is used in tests
  - **Fix**: Created a proper MainWindowMock class that avoids the metaclass conflict, and updated the tests to use this mock instead of importing the real MainWindow
  - **Date**: 2025-03-26

- âœ… MainWindow UI State tests not properly mocking BlockableProgressDialog
  - **Issue**: Tests for the MainWindow UI state management weren't properly testing BlockableProgressDialog creation
  - **Cause**: The mock for BlockableProgressDialog wasn't receiving the correct parameters during the test
  - **Fix**: Updated the mock implementation in the tests to properly verify the creation of BlockableProgressDialog with correct parameters
  - **Date**: 2025-03-26
=======
#### Progress reporting inconsistent (2025-02-20)
- **Issue:** Progress updates not reflecting actual task completion
- **Cause:** Progress calculation not accounting for all subtasks
- **Fix:** Improved progress calculation algorithm and added more detailed reporting
>>>>>>> 4c92bd3d5df130c4ded7e23cf897aa576a05118d

#### Background worker thread crashes (2025-02-25)
- **Issue:** Background worker threads occasionally crashing
- **Cause:** Unhandled exceptions in worker threads
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive exception handling in worker threads and better logging

#### UI remaining blocked after operations (2025-03-01)
- **Issue:** UI elements remaining disabled after operations complete
- **Cause:** Missing cleanup code in exception paths
- **Fix:** Implemented UI State Management System with proper reference counting and cleanup

<<<<<<< HEAD
- âœ… Background worker cleanup issues
  - Improved thread cleanup in BackgroundWorker.__del__
  - Added better error handling for worker cleanup
  - Eliminated forced thread termination during shutdown

- **App crashes during CSV file import**: The application would crash in the middle of processing CSV files, particularly with large files.
  - Fixed by improving the memory management in `csv_service.py`, particularly the `read_csv_chunked` method which now incrementally processes chunks instead of storing all in memory.
  - Added robust error handling for memory errors, allowing partial data recovery.
  - Reduced UI update frequency in progress callbacks to prevent overwhelming the event queue.
  - Improved thread safety and signal handling for cross-thread communication.
  - Added proper resource cleanup and signal disconnection in the `BackgroundWorker` class.
  - Added safeguards against invalid configuration values like chunk size.

## Data Handling Issues
- âœ… ChestDataModel.update_data not notifying correctly
  - Fixed notification logic to ensure data changes are properly communicated
  - Added more detailed logging for debugging

# Remaining Issues

## Minor Issues
- QThread object deletion warning at shutdown
  - Non-critical issue related to Background Worker cleanup
  - Only occurs during application shutdown and doesn't affect functionality
  - Implemented a more graceful shutdown process to avoid thread termination
  - Improved warning messages to debug level to avoid alarming users

- **Memory usage during large file imports**: While improved, importing very large files still requires significant memory. 
  - Could be further improved by implementing disk-based intermediate storage for extremely large datasets.

## Lessons Learned

1. Signal connections require careful debugging to ensure they're properly connected and functioning
2. Progress reporting should have consistent scales and clear distinction between file-specific and overall progress
3. The Qt progress dialog requires explicit visibility commands in some cases
4. Background task error handling is critical for preventing crashes during file operations
5. Debug logging in key methods greatly assists troubleshooting complex interaction issues
6. Thread cleanup during application shutdown requires special handling to avoid errors
7. Tracking state in a dedicated dictionary (_loading_state) provides more consistent UI updates
8. Processing events (QApplication.processEvents()) is important for responsive UI updates during file operations
9. Check Python files for syntax errors such as extraneous code block markers (```) or incorrect indentation
10. Verify color constants and other resources exist before using them in UI components
11. Keep import paths consistent with actual project structure

- **Memory Management Patterns**: Accumulating chunks of data in memory can lead to crashes with large files. Instead:
  - Process data incrementally where possible
  - Implement early exit strategies for memory errors
  - Add progress throttling to reduce overhead
  - Consider using disk-based intermediate storage for very large datasets

- **Signal Safety**: When working with signals across threads:
  - Use robust error handling around every signal emission
  - Implement throttling for high-frequency progress updates
  - Always disconnect signals when done to prevent memory leaks
  - Use try/except blocks around Qt object interactions that might be deleted

- **UI State Management Best Practices**:
  - Use a centralized system for tracking UI state
  - Implement reference counting for nested blocking operations
  - Use context managers for automatic cleanup, even in case of exceptions
  - Separate UI state management from business logic
  - Make blocking/unblocking declarative rather than imperative
  - Avoid timing-dependent solutions
  - Implement thread-safe mechanisms for cross-thread operations

## Ongoing Issues

### UI Blocking After First Import

#### Description
After the first CSV import operation, the UI (especially the data table view) remains blocked even though the import operation has completed. This prevents users from interacting with the imported data.

#### Investigation Progress
1. Initial testing showed that the UI blocking occurs specifically after the first import
2. Timing-based solutions have been attempted but do not consistently resolve the issue
3. Root cause appears to be a fundamental issue with how UI blocking/unblocking is managed
4. UI State Management System is being implemented to address this issue systematically
5. MainWindow integration with UI State Management System completed
6. Test fixes for UI components completed (WelcomeStateWidget, RecentFilesList)
7. Remaining tests to fix for MainWindow UI State

#### Current Solution in Progress
Implementing a comprehensive UI State Management system that:
- Tracks which UI elements are blocked by which operations
- Maintains reference counts for nested operations
- Provides thread-safe access to UI state
- Notifies elements of state changes automatically

### Memory Usage During Large File Imports

#### Description
The application uses excessive memory when importing large CSV files, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors on systems with limited resources.

#### Investigation Progress
1. Profiling shows that large data structures are being loaded entirely into memory
2. Initial chunking implementation helps but does not fully resolve the issue
3. Need to implement more efficient data structures and stream processing

#### Potential Solutions
1. Implement stream processing for file imports
2. Add memory usage monitoring and throttling
3. Implement data paging for large datasets
4. Optimize data structures to reduce memory footprint
