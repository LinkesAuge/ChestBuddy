## Historical Bug Tracking

## Resolved Issues

### 2024-03-26: Comprehensive Improvements to Validation Component Tests

- **Issue**: Tests for ValidationListView, ValidationPreferencesView, and ValidationTabView were unreliable and sometimes failing due to UI event simulation issues, signal timing, and context menu testing problems.
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. UI event simulation doesn't always work reliably in a test environment
  2. Signal-slot connections may not be processed immediately
  3. Mock state wasn't being reset before verification
  4. Context menu testing wasn't properly mocked
  5. Insufficient delay for signal processing
- **Fix**: 
  1. Replaced UI event simulation with direct method calls
  2. Added QTest.qWait(50) for signal processing
  3. Added mock_object.reset_mock() before actions to ensure clean verification
  4. Properly mocked QMenu for context menu testing
  5. Used more reliable methods for verifying signal arguments
  6. Added encoding specification for file operations in tests
  7. Updated testing.md with Qt UI component testing best practices
- **Status**: Fixed, all validation component tests now run reliably and pass consistently

### 2024-03-26: Fixed ValidationService Test Failures
- **Issue**: ValidationService tests were intermittently failing due to state leakage between tests and path resolution issues
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. Tests were sharing validation files, causing state to leak between test cases
  2. Path resolution in ValidationService relied on Path.parents, which was difficult to mock in the test environment
  3. References to the non-existent get_dataframe() method instead of the data property
- **Fix**: 
  1. Added _resolve_validation_path method to ValidationService for better path handling
  2. Created unique test files for each test run to prevent state leakage
  3. Added _reset_for_testing method to ValidationService for proper cleanup
  4. Updated tests to use the data property instead of get_dataframe()
  5. Modified the validation_service fixture to create a clean environment for each test
- **Status**: Fixed, all ValidationService tests now consistently pass

### 2024-03-26: Fixed ValidationTabView Test Skip Issues
- **Issue**: ValidationTabView tests were being skipped due to path resolution issues
- **Root Cause**: Similar to the ValidationService issues, the tests were having trouble with Path.parents mocking
- **Fix**: 
  1. Updated the validation_service fixture in the tests to use direct model assignment rather than patching path resolution
  2. Created validation files in a temporary directory for testing
  3. Removed the skip annotation from the TestValidationTabView class
- **Status**: Fixed, all ValidationTabView tests now run and pass successfully

### 2024-03-26: Fixed TypeError in test_update_manager_data_dependency_integration.py
- **Issue**: MockUpdatable class was causing a TypeError due to metaclass conflict when directly implementing IUpdatable interface
- **Fix**: Modified MockUpdatable to inherit from UpdatableComponent base class instead of directly implementing IUpdatable
- **Related Changes**: 
  - Updated test methods to use correct methods: `schedule_update` instead of `register_component`
  - Updated test methods to use `process_pending_updates` instead of `_process_updates`
- **Status**: Fixed, all tests in this file now pass

### 2024-03-26: Fixed Double Table Population Issue When Loading CSV Files
- **Issue**: When loading CSV files, the table was being populated twice due to duplicate signal connections
- **Root Cause**: `DataManager` was connecting both the `task_completed` signal and the `finished` signal from `BackgroundWorker`, both of which triggered similar processing paths leading to duplicate calls to `_on_csv_load_success`
- **Fix**: Removed the redundant connection of `worker.finished` to `_adapt_task_result` in the `_connect_signals` method, retaining only the more specific `task_completed` signal connection
- **Implementation**: Modified `data_manager.py` to comment out the duplicate signal connection in the `_connect_signals` method
- **Status**: Fixed, CSV files now load correctly without duplicate table population

### 2024-03-28: Fixed Change Detection Issue in ChestDataModel
- **Issue**: ChestDataModel wasn't properly detecting changes and emitting signals when updating data
- **Fix**: Enhanced the _notify_change and update_data methods to ensure data changes are correctly detected and signals are emitted
- **Related Changes**:
  - Updated integration tests to properly validate the change detection
  - Used correct column references in tests to ensure proper data validation
- **Status**: Fixed, all integration tests now pass successfully

### 2024-03-28: Fixed Table Sorting Performance Issues

- **Issue**: Table sorting operations were extremely slow with large datasets, causing UI freezing
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. Manual sorting implementation was rebuilding the entire table model on every sort
  2. Excessive validation status checking was performed during sorting
  3. Inefficient data iteration patterns created overhead
- **Fix**: 
  1. Leveraged built-in QTableView sorting capabilities instead of manual implementation
  2. Removed the redundant `_update_table_with_sorted_data` method
  3. Implemented more efficient data iteration using dictionary-based approach
  4. Streamlined item creation process and implemented batch operations
  5. Added proper handling of sorting state during initial table population
- **Status**: Fixed, sorting is now significantly faster and doesn't cause UI freezing

### 2024-03-28: Fixed QThread Object Deletion Warning
- **Issue**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown
- **Fix**: Ensured proper thread cleanup in the UpdateManager before application shutdown
- **Status**: Fixed, no more warnings during application shutdown

### 2024-03-28: Updated Controller Tests for QApplication
- **Issue**: Some controller tests that required QApplication needed to be updated to use pytest-qt
- **Fix**: Refactored tests to properly use the pytest-qt plugin for QApplication setup
- **Status**: Fixed, all controller tests now run correctly

### 2025-03-27: Fixed Parameter Error in ValidationViewAdapter Initialization

- **Issue**: Application failed to start with error: `BaseView.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'`
- **Root Cause**: The ValidationViewAdapter class was passing a 'name' parameter to its parent BaseView constructor, but the BaseView constructor doesn't accept a 'name' parameter.
- **Fix**: Removed the 'name' parameter from the super().__init__() call in ValidationViewAdapter.__init__ method:
  ```python
  # Before:
  super().__init__(
      name="validation",  # This parameter doesn't exist in BaseView.__init__
      title="Validation",
      parent=parent,
      debug_mode=debug_mode,
  )
  
  # After:
  super().__init__(
      title="Validation",
      parent=parent,
      debug_mode=debug_mode,
  )
  ```
- **Status**: Fixed, application now starts properly and the validation tab view works correctly.

### 2025-03-27: Fixed White Background Issues in ValidationTabView and ValidationListView

- **Issue**: Persistent white backgrounds in the validation UI despite several attempts to apply proper styling. Golden highlights/accents missing across the application.
- **Root Cause**: Qt widget styling requires both property setting AND autoFillBackground to properly render background colors. Several key issues were identified:
  1. Missing "lightContentView" property on widgets (needed for application-wide style)
  2. Missing calls to `setAutoFillBackground(True)` on nested widgets
  3. Missing "container" property on container widgets
  4. Incomplete style inheritance in the widget hierarchy 
- **Fix**:
  1. Added a new `_ensure_widget_styling` method to ValidationTabView that recursively sets the required properties and enables background filling:
     ```python
     def _ensure_widget_styling(self):
         # For each section, ensure proper styling
         for section in [self._players_section, self._chest_types_section, self._sources_section]:
             # Set section's properties (container is already a widget)
             section.setProperty("container", True)
             section.setProperty("lightContentView", True)
             section.setAutoFillBackground(True)
             
             # Find all validation list views within the section
             for list_view in section.findChildren(ValidationListView):
                 list_view.setProperty("lightContentView", True)
                 list_view.setAutoFillBackground(True)
                 
                 # Find child widgets of the list view and set properties
                 for child in list_view.findChildren(QWidget):
                     # Skip input fields which should have white background
                     if not isinstance(child, QLineEdit):
                         child.setProperty("lightContentView", True)
                         child.setAutoFillBackground(True)
     ```
  2. Added explicit property settings to all main widgets in ValidationTabView
  3. Added property and autoFillBackground settings to ValidationListView
  4. Set viewport auto-fill background on list widgets to ensure content shows proper background
- **Status**: Fixed, all views now show the correct background colors throughout the application.

## 2025-03-26: Double Table Population Issue

### Problem
When data was loaded in the ChestBuddy application, the data table would sometimes be populated twice, especially when switching to the Data view before the initial population was complete. This caused performance issues and potential UI inconsistencies.

### Root Cause
We identified that there were two parallel signal paths leading to table population:
1. The `DataView` directly connected to the `ChestDataModel.data_changed` signal, triggering `_update_view`
2. The `DataViewAdapter` connected to the same signal, and would also trigger population through the `UpdateManager`

This dual pathway led to duplicate population in some edge cases, especially during view transitions.

### Solution
Modified `DataViewAdapter.__init__` to disable auto-update on the underlying `DataView`:
```python
# Create the underlying DataView
self._data_view = DataView(data_model)
# Disable auto-update to prevent double population
self._data_view.disable_auto_update()
```

This change ensures that all updates go through the `DataViewAdapter` and the `UpdateManager`, preventing the `DataView` from responding directly to `data_changed` signals, which eliminated the duplicate population issue.

### Testing
We verified that the table population occurs exactly once when loading data and switching between views. The log shows:
```
2025-03-26 05:04:50,181 - chestbuddy.ui.data_view - DEBUG - Auto-update disabled, skipping table update
```
Which confirms that the DataView is no longer reacting to direct data change events.

## 2025-03-26: Fixed Missing Auto-Update in DataViewAdapter

### Problem
After fixing the double table population issue, we encountered a new problem where data wouldn't automatically load in the DataView at all, requiring manual refresh to see any data.

### Root Cause
When we disabled auto-update on the DataView to prevent double population, we didn't ensure that the DataViewAdapter itself had auto-update enabled to receive and process data change events through the proper channel (UpdateManager).

### Solution
Modified `DataViewAdapter.__init__` to explicitly enable auto-update on the adapter itself after disabling it on the DataView:
```python
# Create the underlying DataView
self._data_view = DataView(data_model)
# Disable auto-update to prevent double population
self._data_view.disable_auto_update()
# Ensure the adapter itself has auto-update enabled
self.enable_auto_update()
```

This change ensures that:
1. The DataView doesn't respond directly to data change events (preventing double population)
2. The DataViewAdapter properly receives and processes data change events through the UpdateManager
3. Data is automatically loaded and displayed without manual intervention

### Testing
We verified that:
- Data now correctly loads automatically when files are opened
- There is still no double population of the table
- The user experience is seamless, with data appearing as expected without manual refreshes

## 2025-03-26: Fixed DataViewAdapter Initialization Order Issue

### Problem
After adding auto-update to the DataViewAdapter, the application would fail to start with an error: `'DataViewAdapter' object has no attribute '_signal_manager'`.

### Root Cause
We were calling `self.enable_auto_update()` in the DataViewAdapter's `__init__` method before the parent class constructor (`super().__init__()`) was called. Since the `_signal_manager` attribute is initialized in the parent class, it wasn't available yet when we tried to use it.

### Solution
Moved the `self.enable_auto_update()` call to after the `super().__init__()` call in DataViewAdapter's `__init__` method:
```python
# Create the underlying DataView
self._data_view = DataView(data_model)
# Disable auto-update to prevent double population
self._data_view.disable_auto_update()

# Initialize the base view with debug mode option
super().__init__("Data View", parent, debug_mode=debug_mode)
self.setObjectName("DataViewAdapter")

# Ensure the adapter itself has auto-update enabled
self.enable_auto_update()
```

This fix ensures that all parent class initialization (including the creation of the `_signal_manager`) happens before we try to use it in the `enable_auto_update()` method.

### Testing
We verified that:
- The application starts correctly without errors
- Auto-update functionality works as expected
- Data is displayed automatically when files are opened
- No double population occurs

## 2025-03-26: Fixed Multiple File Browser Popup Issue for Import Functionality

### Problem
When attempting to import files in the ChestBuddy application, multiple file browser dialogs would appear one after another. After selecting files in the first dialog, a second dialog would immediately open, creating a confusing user experience and preventing imports from working.

### Root Cause
After thorough investigation, we identified that:

1. The signal connections for handling import requests were incorrectly implemented using direct lambda connections instead of using the SignalManager:
```python
view.import_requested.connect(lambda parent=self: self._file_controller.open_file(parent))
```

2. This bypass of the proper SignalManager-based connections wasn't following ChestBuddy's signal architecture pattern.

3. The use of lambda functions created potential issues with Qt's signal/slot mechanism, allowing duplicate connections without proper tracking.

### Solution
Implemented a proper SignalManager-based connection system:

1. Created a dedicated slot method in MainWindow to handle import requests while preventing duplicate dialogs:
```python
@Slot()
def _on_import_requested(self):
    """
    Handle import requests from views.
    
    This slot is connected to view import_requested signals via SignalManager.
    It delegates to the FileOperationsController but adds guard logic 
    to prevent duplicate dialogs.
    """
    # Check if we're already handling an import to prevent duplicate dialogs
    if hasattr(self, "_is_handling_import") and self._is_handling_import:
        logger.debug("Already handling an import request, ignoring duplicate")
        return
        
    # Check if we're already showing a progress dialog
    if (
        hasattr(self, "_progress_controller") 
        and self._progress_controller.is_progress_showing()
    ):
        logger.debug("Progress dialog is showing, ignoring import request")
        return
        
    # Set flag to prevent duplicate dialogs during processing
    try:
        self._is_handling_import = True
        logger.debug("Handling import request via FileOperationsController")
        
        # Delegate to file controller
        self._file_controller.open_file(self)
    finally:
        # Always clear the flag when done
        self._is_handling_import = False
```

2. Changed the signal connections to use SignalManager instead of direct lambda connections:
```python
for view_name, view in self._views.items():
    if hasattr(view, "import_requested"):
        logger.debug(f"Connecting {view_name}.import_requested to FileOperationsController")
        # Use SignalManager to connect to handleImportRequest slot (which will call file_controller)
        self._signal_manager.connect(view, "import_requested", self, "_on_import_requested")
```

3. Updated the _open_file method comments to clarify its purpose:
```python
# Note: This method is directly connected to UI actions like menu items
# Import requests from views are now handled by _on_import_requested
# which uses the SignalManager to avoid duplicate connections
```

### Implementation Issue
When implementing this solution, we encountered an error during testing:
```
AttributeError: 'MainWindow' object has no attribute '_signal_manager'. Did you mean: '_data_manager'?
```

The MainWindow class was not properly initializing the signal manager attribute. This requires further investigation to ensure proper integration with the ChestBuddy signal architecture. We need to either:

1. Add a signal_manager parameter to the MainWindow constructor and initialize it properly
2. Use the ChestBuddyApp's signal_manager instance
3. Create a signal_manager instance specifically for MainWindow

Until this is resolved, we need to revert to the direct connection approach that, while not ideal, at least prevents the immediate issue of duplicate file dialogs.

### Testing
After fixing the implementation issue, we'll need to verify that:
- Clicking the import button shows only a single file dialog
- After selecting files, they are properly imported without duplicate dialogs appearing
- The import functionality works consistently across all views
- SignalManager properly tracks connections and prevents duplicates
- The application follows the established signal architecture pattern

## 2025-03-27: Fixed Data Not Loading When Files Selected During Import

### Problem
When attempting to import files in the ChestBuddy application, the file dialog would open and files could be selected, but no data was actually loaded into the application. The application showed recent files were updated, but the data table remained empty.

### Root Cause
After thorough investigation, we identified a critical missing signal connection in the application initialization:

1. The `FileOperationsController.open_file()` method correctly showed the file dialog and emitted a `load_csv_triggered` signal with the selected file paths.

2. However, this signal was never connected to the `DataManager.load_csv()` method in the `_connect_signals` method of `ChestBuddyApp`.

3. Because of this missing connection, files were selected but the actual data loading process was never triggered, resulting in:
   - Recent files being updated
   - "File opened" messages appearing in logs
   - But no actual data loading or display occurring

### Solution
Added the missing signal connection in the `_connect_signals` method of `ChestBuddyApp`:

```python
# Connect file controller's load_csv_triggered to data_manager.load_csv
# This is crucial for file import functionality to work properly
self._signal_manager.connect(
    self._file_controller, "load_csv_triggered", self._data_manager, "load_csv"
)
```

This connection ensures that when files are selected in the file dialog, the actual data loading process is triggered, allowing data to be loaded into the data model and displayed in the UI.

### Testing
The import functionality now works correctly:
- Clicking the import button shows a file dialog
- After selecting files, data is properly loaded and displayed
- The data view shows the imported data
- Recent files are updated appropriately
- No duplicate file dialogs appear

This fix completes the signal chain necessary for proper file import and data loading functionality.

## File Import Not Loading Data - FIXED (2025-03-26)

### Problem
Files could be selected during import, but no data was loaded into the application. The logs showed file selection was successful and recent files were updated, but the data was never loaded and displayed in the data table.

### Root Cause
The signal connection between `FileOperationsController.load_csv_triggered` signal and `DataManager.load_csv` method was missing in the `_connect_signals` method of `ChestBuddyApp` in `app.py`. Without this connection, files were selected but the selected files were never actually loaded.

### Solution
Added the missing signal connection in the `_connect_signals` method of `app.py`:

```python
# Connect file controller's load_csv_triggered to data_manager.load_csv
self._signal_manager.connect(
    self._file_controller, "load_csv_triggered", self._data_manager, "load_csv"
)
```

This ensures that when files are selected in the file dialog, the `load_csv_triggered` signal is emitted, which now properly triggers the `load_csv` method in the `DataManager`.

### Testing Results
✅ Import button works correctly  
✅ CSV files are properly loaded into the application  
✅ Data is displayed in the data table  
✅ Recent files are updated correctly  
✅ No duplicate file dialogs appear  

### Status
✅ All known issues resolved  
✅ Application stable and ready for release

## ValidationViewAdapter Recursive Update Issue (2025-03-26)

#### Issue Description
The ValidationViewAdapter was causing an infinite recursion loop due to the `_on_validation_updated` method directly calling `self.refresh()`. This created a cycle where validation updates triggered further validation updates without proper debouncing.

#### Error Message
```
TypeError: UpdatableView.request_update() got an unexpected keyword argument 'delay'
```

#### Root Cause
The method was incorrectly trying to use `request_update(delay=100)` parameter, but the `request_update` method in `UpdatableView` doesn't accept a `delay` parameter.

#### Solution
Changed the implementation to use the `schedule_update` method instead, which properly supports debouncing with the `debounce_ms` parameter:

```python
def _on_validation_updated(self) -> None:
    """
    Handle validation updates from the validation service.
    
    This method is called when the validation service emits a validation_updated signal.
    It schedules an update to refresh the view with a debounce to prevent recursive calls.
    """
    logger.debug("ValidationViewAdapter: Validation updated")
    # Use schedule_update with debounce instead of request_update with delay
    # to prevent recursive calls when validation updates trigger further validation updates
    self.schedule_update(debounce_ms=100)
```

#### Verification
Confirmed that the application can now load and navigate to the validation tab without encountering recursion errors.

## File Import Dialog Cancellation Bug (2025-03-26)

#### Issue Description
When attempting to import files in the ChestBuddy application, if the user closed the file browser dialog without selecting files, a flag (`_is_handling_import`) was not properly reset. This caused subsequent import attempts to fail because the application incorrectly thought it was still handling the previous import request.

#### Error Behavior
1. User clicks the import button
2. File dialog opens
3. User closes the dialog without selecting files
4. User tries to click import button again
5. Nothing happens - import button doesn't work anymore

#### Root Cause
The issue was in how the MainWindow class tracked the import process:

1. When initiating an import, MainWindow set `_is_handling_import = True` in the `_on_import_requested` method
2. This flag was only reset in the `_on_load_finished` method, which is only called when files are actually loaded
3. If the user canceled the file dialog, the loading process never started, so `_on_load_finished` was never called
4. As a result, the `_is_handling_import` flag remained set to `True`, blocking future import attempts

#### Solution
1. Added a new signal `file_dialog_canceled` to the `FileOperationsController` that is emitted when a file dialog is canceled
2. Modified `FileOperationsController.open_file()` and `save_file_as()` to emit this signal when their dialogs are canceled
3. Added a handler `_on_file_dialog_canceled()` in MainWindow that properly resets both `_is_handling_import` and `_is_opening_file` flags
4. Connected this handler to the new signal in the `_register_with_controllers` method

```python
# In FileOperationsController
def open_file(self, parent=None):
    # ...existing code...
    if file_dialog.exec():
        # ...file selection handling...
        return files
    else:
        logger.debug("File dialog canceled by user - no files selected")
        self.file_dialog_canceled.emit()
        return None

# In MainWindow
@Slot()
def _on_file_dialog_canceled(self):
    """
    Handle cancellation of file dialog.
    
    This resets the import handling flags to ensure future import requests work correctly.
    """
    logger.debug("File dialog canceled, resetting import handling flags")
    self._is_handling_import = False
    self._is_opening_file = False
```

#### Verification
Confirmed that the application now correctly handles file dialog cancellation:
1. When the file dialog is canceled, the flags are properly reset
2. Subsequent import attempts work correctly
3. The import button remains functional even after a user cancels import
4. No error messages or freezes occur when the user cancels multiple imports

## 2025-03-26: Fixed File Dialog Cancellation Issue

### Problem
When canceling a file browser dialog during an import or save operation, a second dialog would sometimes appear. This issue affected user experience and made file operations confusing.

### Root Cause
We identified two key causes:
1. The `FileOperationsController` wasn't properly emitting a `file_dialog_canceled` signal when users canceled file dialogs
2. The controller was missing methods to properly track and save the last used directory
3. There was no reliable flag mechanism to prevent duplicate dialogs from appearing

### Solution
Modified `FileOperationsController` with several improvements:

1. Added a flag mechanism to prevent duplicate dialogs:
```python
def __init__(self, data_manager, config_manager: ConfigManager, signal_manager=None):
    # ...existing code...
    self._is_showing_dialog = False  # Flag to prevent duplicate dialogs
```

2. Added explicit cancel signal emission in both dialog methods:
```python
def open_file(self, parent=None):
    # ...existing code...
    if files:
        # ...handle file selection...
        return files
    else:
        logger.debug("File dialog canceled by user - no files selected")
        self.file_dialog_canceled.emit()
        return None
```

3. Implemented proper directory management methods:
```python
def _get_last_directory(self):
    """
    Get the last directory used for file operations from config.
    
    Returns:
        str: Path to the last used directory or user's documents folder if not set
    """
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Get the last directory from config or default to documents
    last_dir = self._config_manager.get(
        "Files", "last_directory", str(Path.home() / "Documents")
    )
    
    # Fix: Ensure last_dir is a string, not a list
    if isinstance(last_dir, list):
        last_dir = str(Path.home() / "Documents")
        
    logger.debug(f"Retrieved last directory: {last_dir}")
    return last_dir

def _save_last_directory(self, directory):
    """
    Save the last directory used for file operations to config.
    
    Args:
        directory (str): Path to save
    """
    logger.debug(f"Saving last directory: {directory}")
    self._config_manager.set("Files", "last_directory", directory)
```

### Testing
We verified that:
- Only one file dialog opens at a time
- When a dialog is canceled, the state is properly reset
- The last used directory is correctly remembered between operations
- Debug logs confirm the correct operation of dialog opening, file selection, and dialog cancellation

While there is still a double call to `_on_import_requested` after file selection (due to a different issue), our flag mechanism prevents this from causing duplicate dialogs.

## [2025-03-27] Standardization of Dark Theme Throughout Application

### Issue
The application had inconsistent theming where some UI components were using light backgrounds while others used dark backgrounds. This created visual inconsistency and confusion with the `lightContentView` property which, despite its name, was intended to apply dark theme styling.

### Root Cause
1. The `style.py` file contained a mix of light and dark color definitions, with some light-themed colors still being used in various UI components.
2. The `lightContentView` property name was misleading as it actually applied dark styling, causing confusion in code maintenance.
3. Multiple view files had hardcoded light color values or relied on default Qt backgrounds.

### Fix
1. Updated `style.py` to replace light-themed background colors with dark theme equivalents:
   - Changed `BACKGROUND_PRIMARY` to `Colors.DARK_CONTENT_BG`
   - Changed `BACKGROUND_SECONDARY` to `Colors.DARK_CONTENT_BG`
   - Changed `BACKGROUND_INPUT` to a darker variant for input fields

2. Updated `validation_list_view.py`:
   - Changed the background color of the container widget to `Colors.DARK_CONTENT_BG`
   - Updated the search input stylesheet to use dark theme colors
   - Modified the list widget stylesheet to use dark theme colors
   - Updated the vertical scrollbar styling to match the dark theme
   - Ensured the context menu styling used dark theme colors

3. Updated `validation_tab_view.py`:
   - Set the background color of the main view to `Colors.DARK_CONTENT_BG`
   - Updated the splitter's stylesheet to use dark theme colors
   - Ensured all validation list sections use dark theme styling

### Status
✅ Fixed - The application now displays a consistent dark theme across all UI components. All views (Dashboard, Validation, Data, Charts, Correction) now properly display dark backgrounds and styling.

## UI Performance Issues

### Issue: UI Freezing During Table Population
- **Problem**: When loading large datasets, the UI would become completely unresponsive during table population, causing a poor user experience and making the application appear frozen.
- **Cause**: The table population process was processing all rows synchronously in a single pass, blocking the main UI thread until completion.
- **Impact**: Users experienced significant freezing when working with datasets larger than a few hundred rows, making the application difficult to use with real-world data sizes.
- **Solution**: Implemented a chunked processing approach that:
  1. Processes a limited number of rows (200) at a time
  2. Uses QTimer.singleShot(0, self._populate_chunk) to yield control back to the event loop between chunks
  3. Maintains state variables to track progress (current_row_index, rows_to_process)
  4. Provides visual feedback during the population process
- **Implementation**: Added a new chunked approach in DataView.populate_table() with supporting methods:
  - _populate_chunk(): Processes a single chunk of 200 rows
  - _finalize_population(): Completes the process after all chunks are processed
- **Result**: The UI remains responsive even when loading large datasets (10,000+ rows), and users can see the progress as rows are added to the table.
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Apply similar chunking approach to validation process
  - Add more granular progress reporting
  - Consider true background processing for extremely large datasets (100,000+ rows)

### Issue: Delayed UI Response After Import
- **Problem**: After importing data and closing the progress window, there was a long delay (2000ms) before the data view became responsive.
- **Cause**: In the _on_load_finished method of ChestBuddyApp, there was an excessive delay before populating the data table: QTimer.singleShot(2000, self._main_window.populate_data_table)
- **Impact**: Users experienced a confusing "dead time" after import, where the progress dialog had closed but the application appeared unresponsive.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Reduced the delay from 2000ms to 100ms to improve responsiveness
  2. Documented the reason for the delay (allowing time for the UI to update after progress dialog closes)
- **Implementation**: Modified the QTimer.singleShot call in ChestBuddyApp._on_load_finished
- **Result**: The UI now responds much more quickly after data import, providing a smoother user experience.
- **Additional Learning**: Always question hardcoded delays in UI code - they can often be reduced or eliminated with proper event handling.

## Ongoing Issues

All known issues have been resolved. The application is now stable and ready for release.

## 2024-03-27: Fixed ValidationListView Test Issues After UI Enhancement

### Bug: ValidationListView Tests Failing After UI Enhancements

**Description:**  
After implementing UI enhancements to the ValidationListView (adding search functionality, visual indicators, and improved styling), the test_add_duplicate_entry test started failing. The test expected exactly 3 items in the list widget after attempting to add a duplicate entry, but there was only 1 item due to the new filtering behavior.

**Root Cause:**  
The UI enhancement added filtering functionality that changed how the list behaves when searching. When a duplicate entry was attempted to be added using the search text, the list remained filtered to show only the matching entry instead of showing all entries.

**Resolution:**  
1. Updated the test_add_duplicate_entry test to:
   - Save the initial entry count from the model rather than assuming 3 entries
   - Check that the filtered list properly shows just the searched item
   - Explicitly clear the search to verify the full list still has the original count
   - Verify both model state and view representation

2. Enhanced ValidationListView class to:
   - Ensure consistent behavior between model and view during filtering
   - Add _load_entries() calls to refresh the full list when needed
   - Properly handle the filtered state after duplicate entry attempts
   - Maintain consistent state between model and view

**Prevention:**  
- Added more robust tests that verify both model state and view representation
- Improved separation between filtering logic and entry manipulation
- Enhanced documentation for the filtering behavior
- Made tests more resilient to UI changes by avoiding hard-coded assumptions

**Impact:**  
- All tests now pass correctly with the enhanced UI
- Filtering behavior works consistently in both the UI and tests
- The test suite is more robust against future UI changes

## Validation System Bugs

### ValidationViewAdapter Recursive Update Issue (2025-03-26)

#### Issue Description
The ValidationViewAdapter was causing an infinite recursion loop due to the `_on_validation_updated` method directly calling `self.refresh()`. This created a cycle where validation updates triggered further validation updates without proper debouncing.

#### Error Message
```
TypeError: UpdatableView.request_update() got an unexpected keyword argument 'delay'
```

#### Root Cause
The method was incorrectly trying to use `request_update(delay=100)` parameter, but the `request_update` method in `UpdatableView` doesn't accept a `delay` parameter.

#### Solution
Changed the implementation to use the `schedule_update` method instead, which properly supports debouncing with the `debounce_ms` parameter:

```python
def _on_validation_updated(self) -> None:
    """
    Handle validation updates from the validation service.
    
    This method is called when the validation service emits a validation_updated signal.
    It schedules an update to refresh the view with a debounce to prevent recursive calls.
    """
    logger.debug("ValidationViewAdapter: Validation updated")
    # Use schedule_update with debounce instead of request_update with delay
    # to prevent recursive calls when validation updates trigger further validation updates
    self.schedule_update(debounce_ms=100)
```

#### Verification
Confirmed that the application can now load and navigate to the validation tab without encountering recursion errors.

## Fixed Bugs

### 2025-03-27: Qt.QSize Not Found Error (Fixed)

**Error Message:**
```
AttributeError: type object 'PySide6.QtCore.Qt' has no attribute 'QSize'
```

**Symptoms:**
- Application crashes on startup with error in validation_tab_view.py
- Error occurs when setting icon size for toolbars using `Qt.QSize`

**Root Cause:**
In PySide6, QSize is a class in QtCore module, not an attribute of the Qt class. The code was incorrectly using `Qt.QSize` instead of just `QSize`.

**Fix:**
1. Properly import QSize from PySide6.QtCore: `from PySide6.QtCore import Qt, Signal, QSize`
2. Use QSize directly for setting icon sizes: `toolbar.setIconSize(QSize(16, 16))`

**Additional Notes:**
- This is a common mistake when transitioning from other Qt bindings or older versions
- Always check the proper import paths in PySide6 documentation

### 2025-03-27: ValidationListView Constructor Parameter Mismatch (Fixed)

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: 'PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget.__init__' called with wrong argument types:
  PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget.__init__(WindowsPath)
```

**Symptoms:**
- Application crashes on startup after fixing the previous QSize issue
- Error occurs in initialization of ValidationListView

**Root Cause:**
ValidationListView constructor was being called with incorrect parameters. It was being passed `title.lower()` and `list_path` (a WindowsPath object), but it expected a ValidationListModel object as the first parameter.

**Fix:**
1. Modified `_create_validation_list_section` to get the appropriate ValidationListModel from the validation service
2. Pass the model to ValidationListView instead of the title and path
3. Updated attribute naming to handle spaces in section names (e.g., "chest types" → "chest_types")

**Additional Notes:**
- Parameter mismatches can be subtle errors that only appear at runtime
- Always check constructor signatures when creating objects
- Use normalized naming for attributes to avoid spaces and special characters

### 2025-03-27: Missing Signal in ValidationListView (Fixed)

**Error Message:**
```
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'entries_changed'
```

**Symptoms:**
- Application crashes on startup after fixing the parameter mismatch
- Error occurs when trying to connect to a signal that doesn't exist

**Root Cause:**
The code was trying to connect to an `entries_changed` signal on the ValidationListView object, but the signal was actually on the ValidationListModel.

**Fix:**
1. Modified `_connect_signals` to connect to the model's signals instead of the view's
2. Added checks to only connect if the attributes/signals exist
3. Fixed parameters in lambda expressions to pass checked=False parameter to prevent errors

**Additional Notes:**
- In Qt's signal system, it's important to connect to the right object's signals
- Using defensive checks (like `if hasattr()`) can prevent runtime errors
- Always check the documentation for signal signatures

### 2025-03-27: Missing Message Parameter in _on_status_changed (Fixed)

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: ValidationTabView._on_status_changed() missing 1 required positional argument: 'message'
```

**Symptoms:**
- Application runs but shows errors in the console when interacting with validation tab
- Error occurs when status_changed signal is emitted without a message parameter

**Root Cause:**
The `_on_status_changed` method required a message parameter but sometimes the signal was emitted without one.

**Fix:**
1. Made the message parameter optional with a default empty string
2. Added a check to only show the message if it's not empty

**Additional Notes:**
- Signal handlers should be flexible to handle cases where parameters might be missing
- Adding default values for parameters is a good defensive programming practice
- Using conditional logic to handle different parameter cases enhances robustness

### 2025-03-27: Fixed Import/Export in ValidationListView

**Error Message:**
```
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'add_entry'
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'remove_selected_entries'
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'import_entries'
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'export_entries'
```

**Symptoms:**
- Import and export buttons in the validation tab were non-functional
- Validation lists weren't loading entries from data/validation directory properly
- Clicking on add, remove, import, or export buttons caused errors

**Root Cause:**
The ValidationListView class was missing several required methods that were being called by ValidationTabView when buttons were clicked:
- add_entry
- remove_selected_entries
- import_entries
- export_entries

Although the underlying ValidationListModel had the necessary functionality, the view didn't have methods to present UI dialogs and call the model methods.

**Fix:**
1. Added the missing methods to ValidationListView:
   ```python
   def add_entry(self) -> None:
       """Add a new entry to the list."""
       text, ok = QInputDialog.getText(self, "Add Entry", "Enter new entry:")
       if ok and text:
           if self._model.add_entry(text):
               self.status_changed.emit("Entry added successfully")
           else:
               QMessageBox.warning(
                   self, "Add Failed", f"The entry '{text}' already exists in the list."
               )

   def remove_selected_entries(self) -> None:
       """Remove selected entries from the list."""
       selected_items = self._list_widget.selectedItems()
       if selected_items:
           self._remove_entries(selected_items)
       else:
           QMessageBox.information(self, "Remove", "No items selected")

   def import_entries(self) -> None:
       """Import entries from a file."""
       file_path, _ = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(self, "Import Entries", "", "Text Files (*.txt)")
       if file_path:
           success, duplicates = self._model.import_from_file(Path(file_path))
           if success:
               self.status_changed.emit(f"Imported entries successfully")
           else:
               if duplicates:
                   QMessageBox.warning(
                       self,
                       "Import Failed",
                       f"Found {len(duplicates)} duplicate entries. Import canceled.",
                   )
               else:
                   QMessageBox.critical(self, "Import Failed", "Failed to import entries")

   def export_entries(self) -> None:
       """Export entries to a file."""
       file_path, _ = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(self, "Export Entries", "", "Text Files (*.txt)")
       if file_path:
           if self._model.export_to_file(Path(file_path)):
               self.status_changed.emit(f"Exported entries successfully")
           else:
               QMessageBox.critical(self, "Export Failed", "Failed to export entries")
   ```
   
2. Updated the status_changed signal to include a string parameter:
   ```python
   status_changed = Signal(str)
   ```

3. Added import for Path from pathlib and QFileDialog from Qt widgets

**Additional Notes:**
- After implementation, the import/export functionality works correctly
- The validation lists correctly load from data/validation directory 
- Testing showed successful import from the Players list with 101 entries, and Sources list with 82 entries
- The validation lists now display correct values from data/validation files

**Prevention:**
- When implementing views that interact with models, ensure all required UI methods are implemented
- Match signal parameters between emitter and receivers
- Test all UI functionality before committing code

**Impact:**
- Users can now properly import and export validation lists
- Validation lists are correctly populated from the data/validation directory
- Import/export workflow is fully functional

## Ongoing Issues

### 2025-03-27: Missing AttributeError for ValidationListView Methods

**Error Messages:**
```
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'add_entry'
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'remove_selected_entries'
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'import_entries'
AttributeError: 'ValidationListView' object has no attribute 'export_entries'
```

**Symptoms:**
- Application starts but throws errors in the console when clicking buttons in the validation view
- Error occurs when trying to call methods that don't exist on ValidationListView

**Current Status:**
- These errors don't prevent the application from running but will cause problems when the user tries to add, remove, import, or export entries
- Needs to be fixed by implementing these methods in ValidationListView or ensuring the action handlers connect to existing methods

**Attempted Solutions:**
- None yet - this issue was discovered during testing after fixing the previous issues

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the missing methods in ValidationListView
- Or modify the action handlers in ValidationTabView to call existing methods with the correct names

### 2025-03-27: Fixed Data Path Inconsistency

**Error Message:**
```
2025-03-27 15:57:56,957 - chestbuddy.core.services.validation_service - WARNING - No config manager available, using default path: D:\Projekte\ChestBuddy\data\validation
```

**Symptoms:**
- Validation files were being saved in the project root directory at `D:\Projekte\ChestBuddy\data\validation\` instead of the package-level data directory at `D:\Projekte\ChestBuddy\chestbuddy\data\validation\`
- Import and CSV files were already correctly using the package-level directory (`chestbuddy/data/input/`)
- This inconsistency could lead to validation lists not being found or updated correctly

**Root Cause:**
The `ValidationService` class was calculating default paths using `Path(__file__).parents[3]` which was resolving to the project root directory instead of the package directory. The validation path calculation was incorrect:

```python
# Incorrect path calculation (went too far up in the directory tree)
validation_path = Path(__file__).parents[3] / "data" / "validation"
```

This was happening in multiple places in the `validation_service.py` file.

**Fix:**
1. Changed all instances of `parents[3]` to `parents[2]` in ValidationService.py to correctly point to the package directory:

```python
# Corrected path calculation
validation_path = Path(__file__).parents[2] / "data" / "validation"
```

2. Updated the config.ini file to use an absolute path instead of a relative path:

```ini
# Before
validation_lists_dir = chestbuddy\data\validation

# After
validation_lists_dir = D:\Projekte\ChestBuddy\chestbuddy\data\validation
```

3. Copied existing validation files from the project root directory to the package directory to ensure no data was lost.

**Additional Notes:**
- Confirmed that the application now correctly loads validation files from `D:\Projekte\ChestBuddy\chestbuddy\data\validation\`
- The logs show that validation files are now properly being accessed from the package-level directory
- The validation lists now contain the correct entries and can be imported/exported successfully
- The application correctly found 101 players, 72 chest types, and 82 sources in the validation files

**Prevention:**
- Always use consistent path calculations in the codebase
- Consider using a centralized configuration for all data paths
- Use the appropriate number of parent directory levels when calculating relative paths
- Prefer absolute paths in configuration files for critical directories

**Impact:**
- All data files (validation lists, input CSVs, corrections, etc.) are now consistently stored in the package-level `chestbuddy/data/` directory
- Improved file organization and consistency
- Reduced risk of data loss or synchronization issues between different parts of the application

### 2025-03-27: Updated ValidationListModel Import Behavior

**Issue Description:**
When importing a file into a validation list, the application was checking for duplicates and canceling the import if any were found, instead of replacing all entries with the imported ones.

**Error Behavior:**
1. User clicks import button in a validation list
2. User selects a file to import
3. If the file contains entries that already exist in the list, a warning appears and the import is canceled
4. The expected behavior was to replace all existing entries regardless of duplicates

**Root Cause:**
The `import_from_file` method in `ValidationListModel` was designed to check for duplicates and only replace entries if no duplicates were found. This was a defensive design choice that prevented accidental overwriting of existing data, but didn't match the user's expectation of a complete replacement.

**Solution:**
1. Modified the `import_from_file` method in `ValidationListModel` to replace all entries regardless of duplicates:
```python
# Replace current entries with imported entries, regardless of duplicates
self.entries = set(entries)
if self.save_entries():
    self.entries_changed.emit()
    logger.info(f"Successfully imported {len(entries)} entries from {file_path}, replacing all existing entries")
    return True, []
```

2. Updated the `import_entries` method in `ValidationListView` to:
   - Add a confirmation dialog warning users that all entries will be replaced
   - Remove the duplicate checking code
   - Update the success message to reflect the replacement behavior

**Testing:**
The modified import functionality has been tested to verify:
- A confirmation dialog appears before importing
- If the user confirms, all existing entries are replaced with the imported ones
- If the user cancels, no changes are made
- The import works correctly regardless of duplicate entries

**Status:**
Fixed. Validation list import now replaces all existing entries with the imported ones, providing a more intuitive user experience for list replacement operations.

## Theme System Inconsistencies

**Issue:** White backgrounds appearing in UI elements instead of consistent dark theme. Golden highlights/accents missing across the application.

**Root Cause:** The `lightContentView` property was being used to apply light styling to widgets, creating inconsistency with the application's desired dark theme. The property was setting background colors to light values (`#F7FAFC`) instead of dark values, and golden accents (`#D4AF37`) were not being consistently applied to highlights and selections.

**Fix:**
1. Modified `style.py` to make the `lightContentView` property apply dark styling instead of light styling
   - Changed background color to `#2D3748` (dark gray) for widgets with `lightContentView="true"`
   - Ensured proper text colors (light on dark) across all components
   - Added consistent styling for various widget types (buttons, lists, tables, etc.)
2. Enhanced styling for specific components:
   - Added proper golden highlight colors for selected items
   - Updated button styling with hover effects and golden accents
   - Added better styling for scroll bars with golden highlights
   - Ensured consistent styling for all form controls
3. Added new dark theme background color constants to the `Colors` class
   - `DARK_BG_PRIMARY = "#1A2C42"` (Dark blue)
   - `DARK_BG_SECONDARY = "#263D5A"` (Lighter blue)
   - `DARK_BG_TERTIARY = "#0F1A2A"` (Darkest blue)
   - `DARK_CONTENT_BG = "#2D3748"` (Content area background)

**Status:** Fixed. The application now displays a consistent dark theme with proper golden accents across all views.

### 2024-03-27: Fixed UI Responsiveness Issue After Data Import

- **Issue**: After importing data and closing the progress window, there was a long delay (several seconds) before the data view became responsive, causing a poor user experience.
- **Root Cause**: In the `_on_load_finished` method of the `ChestBuddyApp` class, there was a 2000ms (2 second) delay before starting to populate the data table after the progress dialog was closed.
- **Fix**: Reduced the delay from 2000ms to 100ms in the `QTimer.singleShot` call:
  ```python
  # Before:
  QTimer.singleShot(2000, self._main_window.populate_data_table)
  
  # After:
  QTimer.singleShot(100, self._main_window.populate_data_table)
  ```
- **Status**: Fixed, UI now responds much more quickly after data import.
- **Future Improvements**: 
  1. Consider implementing asynchronous table population to further improve responsiveness
  2. Implement chunked loading for large datasets
  3. Add progress indication during table population

### 2024-03-28: Fixed UI Unresponsiveness During Table Population

- **Issue**: The application's UI would become completely unresponsive when importing data files and displaying them in the data view, especially for large datasets. This was happening after the progress window closed, during the table population phase.
- **Root Cause**: The table population process in `DataView.populate_table` was executing synchronously in the main UI thread, blocking the Qt event loop while creating potentially thousands of table items all at once.
- **Fix**: Implemented a chunked table population approach:
  1. Modified `DataView.populate_table` to set up the table structure and prepare for chunked processing
  2. Created a new `_populate_chunk` method that processes a limited number of rows at a time (200 rows per chunk)
  3. Used `QTimer.singleShot` to schedule each chunk processing with small delays between chunks
  4. Added a `_finalize_population` method to complete the process after all chunks are done
  5. Added progress updates during the chunking process so the user knows what's happening
  ```python
  def _populate_chunk(self) -> None:
      # Process current chunk of rows
      # ...
      # Schedule next chunk with a small delay to keep UI responsive
      QTimer.singleShot(5, self._populate_chunk)
  ```
- **Status**: Fixed, the UI now remains responsive during table population for large datasets. The user sees progress updates as rows are processed in chunks.
- **Note**: This is a significant improvement to the overall user experience, as the application no longer appears frozen after importing large files.

### 2025-03-28: Table Validation Optimization Plan

- **Issue**: Excessive cell updates during validation causing performance issues and console spam. Logs show thousands of "Skipping cell update" messages.
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. The validation system updates all validatable cells on every validation change instead of tracking specific invalid cells
  2. No persistent tracking of which cells currently have validation styling applied
  3. Inefficient full-table scan to apply/remove validation status
  4. Row-level validation results requiring translation to cell-level styling
- **Current Fix**: 
  - Modified validation handling to only set validation status for specifically invalid cells
  - Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary cell updates
- **Proposed Advanced Implementation**:
  1. Create a `ValidationStateTracker` class to maintain a persistent map of invalid cells
  2. Integrate directly with Qt's model/view framework:
     ```python
     class ValidationStateTracker:
         """Tracks validation states for table cells."""
         
         def __init__(self):
             # Dictionary tracking invalid cells: {(row, col_name): ValidationStatus}
             self._invalid_cells = {}
             
         def set_invalid(self, row, col_name, status=ValidationStatus.INVALID):
             """Mark a cell as invalid with specific status."""
             self._invalid_cells[(row, col_name)] = status
             
         def clear_invalid(self, row, col_name):
             """Clear invalid status for a cell."""
             if (row, col_name) in self._invalid_cells:
                 del self._invalid_cells[(row, col_name)]
                 
         def is_invalid(self, row, col_name):
             """Check if a cell is marked invalid."""
             return (row, col_name) in self._invalid_cells
             
         def get_status(self, row, col_name):
             """Get validation status for a cell."""
             return self._invalid_cells.get((row, col_name), None)
             
         def get_invalid_cells(self):
             """Get all invalid cells."""
             return list(self._invalid_cells.keys())
             
         def clear_all(self):
             """Clear all validation states."""
             self._invalid_cells.clear()
             
         def update_from_validation_results(self, invalid_rows, validation_columns):
             """Calculate cell updates from validation results."""
             # Track cells before update
             old_invalid_cells = set(self._invalid_cells.keys())
             new_invalid_cells = set()
             
             # Calculate new invalid cells
             for row_idx in invalid_rows:
                 for col_name in validation_columns:
                     # Check if this column is invalid in this row
                     col_valid = invalid_rows[row_idx].get(f"{col_name.lower()}_valid", True)
                     if not col_valid:
                         new_invalid_cells.add((row_idx, col_name))
                         self.set_invalid(row_idx, col_name)
             
             # Find cells that were invalid but are now valid
             fixed_cells = old_invalid_cells - new_invalid_cells
             for row, col in fixed_cells:
                 self.clear_invalid(row, col)
                 
             # Return changes for efficient UI updates
             return {
                 'new_invalid': new_invalid_cells - old_invalid_cells,
                 'fixed': fixed_cells,
                 'unchanged': old_invalid_cells & new_invalid_cells
             }
     ```
  3. Optimize DataView for targeted updates:
     ```python
     def _emit_targeted_update_signals(self, changes):
         """Emit optimized dataChanged signals for validation updates."""
         if not self._table_model:
             return
             
         # Group changes by column for more efficient updates
         by_column = {}
         
         # Process all changed cells (new invalid + fixed)
         all_changed = changes['new_invalid'].union(changes['fixed'])
         for row, col in all_changed:
             if col not in by_column:
                 by_column[col] = []
             by_column[col].append(row)
         
         # For each column, find continuous ranges and emit signals
         for col, rows in by_column.items():
             col_idx = self._table_model.get_column_index(col)
             if col_idx == -1:
                 continue
                 
             # Sort rows for range detection
             rows.sort()
             
             # Find continuous ranges of rows
             ranges = []
             range_start = rows[0]
             prev_row = rows[0]
             
             for row in rows[1:]:
                 if row > prev_row + 1:  # Gap detected
                     # Complete current range
                     ranges.append((range_start, prev_row))
                     # Start new range
                     range_start = row
                 prev_row = row
                 
             # Add final range
             ranges.append((range_start, prev_row))
             
             # Emit dataChanged for each continuous range
             for start_row, end_row in ranges:
                 top_left = self._table_model.index(start_row, col_idx)
                 bottom_right = self._table_model.index(end_row, col_idx)
                 self._table_model.dataChanged.emit(top_left, bottom_right, [ValidationRole])
     ```
- **Benefits**:
  1. Precise tracking of cells with validation status
  2. Minimal UI updates - only cells that change state get updated
  3. Efficient Qt signaling using dataChanged with specific ranges
  4. Better alignment with Qt's model/view architecture
  5. Reduced logging noise by eliminating unnecessary cell checks
  6. Significantly improved performance for large datasets
  7. Better code maintainability with centralized validation tracking
- **Status**: Partially fixed with simpler solution. Advanced implementation planned.

### 2025-03-27: Fixed Parameter Error in ValidationViewAdapter Initialization

- **Issue**: Application failed to start with error: `BaseView.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'`
- **Root Cause**: The ValidationViewAdapter class was passing a 'name' parameter to its parent BaseView constructor, but the BaseView constructor doesn't accept a 'name' parameter.
- **Fix**: Removed the 'name' parameter from the super().__init__() call in ValidationViewAdapter.__init__ method:
  ```python
  # Before:
  super().__init__(
      name="validation",  # This parameter doesn't exist in BaseView.__init__
      title="Validation",
      parent=parent,
      debug_mode=debug_mode,
  )
  
  # After:
  super().__init__(
      title="Validation",
      parent=parent,
      debug_mode=debug_mode,
  )
  ```
- **Status**: Fixed, application now starts properly and the validation tab view works correctly.
