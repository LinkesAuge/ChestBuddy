## Resolved Issues

### 2024-03-26: Fixed TypeError in test_update_manager_data_dependency_integration.py
- **Issue**: MockUpdatable class was causing a TypeError due to metaclass conflict when directly implementing IUpdatable interface
- **Fix**: Modified MockUpdatable to inherit from UpdatableComponent base class instead of directly implementing IUpdatable
- **Related Changes**: 
  - Updated test methods to use correct methods: `schedule_update` instead of `register_component`
  - Updated test methods to use `process_pending_updates` instead of `_process_updates`
- **Status**: Fixed, all tests in this file now pass

### 2024-03-26: Fixed Double Table Population Issue When Loading CSV Files
- **Issue**: When loading CSV files, the table was being populated twice due to duplicate signal connections
- **Root Cause**: `DataManager` was connecting both the `task_completed` signal and the `finished` signal from `BackgroundWorker`, both of which triggered similar processing paths leading to duplicate calls to `_on_csv_load_success`
- **Fix**: Removed the redundant connection of `worker.finished` to `_adapt_task_result` in the `_connect_signals` method, retaining only the more specific `task_completed` signal connection
- **Implementation**: Modified `data_manager.py` to comment out the duplicate signal connection in the `_connect_signals` method
- **Status**: Fixed, CSV files now load correctly without duplicate table population

### 2024-03-28: Fixed Change Detection Issue in ChestDataModel
- **Issue**: ChestDataModel wasn't properly detecting changes and emitting signals when updating data
- **Fix**: Enhanced the _notify_change and update_data methods to ensure data changes are correctly detected and signals are emitted
- **Related Changes**:
  - Updated integration tests to properly validate the change detection
  - Used correct column references in tests to ensure proper data validation
- **Status**: Fixed, all integration tests now pass successfully

### 2024-03-28: Fixed QThread Object Deletion Warning
- **Issue**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown
- **Fix**: Ensured proper thread cleanup in the UpdateManager before application shutdown
- **Status**: Fixed, no more warnings during application shutdown

### 2024-03-28: Updated Controller Tests for QApplication
- **Issue**: Some controller tests that required QApplication needed to be updated to use pytest-qt
- **Fix**: Refactored tests to properly use the pytest-qt plugin for QApplication setup
- **Status**: Fixed, all controller tests now run correctly
