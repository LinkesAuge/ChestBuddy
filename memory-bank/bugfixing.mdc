  - Fixed by ensuring the dialog is created with the right settings in MainWindow._on_load_started
  - Set minimum duration to 0 to show immediately
  - Added explicit visibility commands

- ✅ Data not displaying in table view after loading
  - Fixed the DataView._update_view method to correctly display data from the model
  - Added clearer logs to trace data flow
  - Improved error handling in update methods

- ✅ Multiple file import crashing
  - Fixed progress handling in MultiCSVLoadTask
  - Improved error resilience in _on_load_progress method
  - Added proper error handling for the progress dialog updates

- ✅ Progress dialog consistency issues
  - Enhanced MainWindow._on_load_progress to provide consistent information
  - Added proper tracking of file count, current file, and row progress
  - Improved visibility handling to ensure dialog stays visible throughout the loading process
  - Added more descriptive messages showing file progress (x/y) and row count

- ✅ UI not unblocking after first import when confirming progress dialog
  - Fixed in MainWindow._close_progress_dialog by adding a call to _update_ui() after closing the dialog
  - Added detailed comments explaining the importance of this update
  - This ensures all UI elements are properly enabled after the user clicks "Confirm"
  - Only affected the first import operation, subsequent imports worked correctly

- ✅ SyntaxError in progress_bar.py
  - Fixed by removing extraneous backticks (```) at the end of the file
  - This was causing the application to fail at startup

- ✅ Incorrect import in main_window.py
  - Fixed incorrect import path for DataView module
  - Changed from 'chestbuddy.ui.widgets.data_view' to 'chestbuddy.ui.data_view'

- ✅ Missing color constant in progress_dialog.py
  - Fixed reference to non-existent color constant TEXT_PRIMARY
  - Changed to use TEXT_LIGHT which is available in the Colors class

- ✅ Progress dialog not closing properly after table population
  - Fixed the ProgressDialog._on_cancel_clicked method to always close the dialog after emitting the canceled signal
  - Simplified the ProgressDialog.close() method to avoid disconnecting critical signals
  - Updated MainWindow._finalize_loading to avoid breaking the cancel button functionality

- ✅ Multiple dialogs appearing during CSV import
  - Fixed by ensuring only one dialog is used throughout the entire import process
  - Modified DataManager._on_csv_load_success to prevent showing dialog for table population
  - Updated MainWindow._on_load_finished to keep the dialog open for user confirmation

- ✅ Progress dialog inappropriately showing table population status
  - Modified MainWindow._on_load_finished to keep the dialog open for explicit user confirmation
  - Ensured cancel button is renamed to "Close" once loading completes
  - Dialog no longer automatically closes, allowing users to review final status

- ✅ Error dialog displaying when there's no data
- ✅ Popup error when trying to create a chart with missing data
- ✅ Table with zero height after first import
- ✅ Progress dialog not showing during file loading
- ✅ Data not displaying in table view after loading
- ✅ Progress dialog not closing properly in some edge cases
- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (first attempt)
- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (second attempt)
  - **Issue**: The UI would remain blocked after confirming the progress dialog on the first import, but worked correctly on subsequent imports.
  - **Cause**: The sequence of operations in `_close_progress_dialog()` didn't properly account for event processing during view transitions after the first import.
  - **Fix**: Improved the event processing sequence in `_close_progress_dialog()` to ensure UI updates happen at the right time. Added multiple strategic calls to `QApplication.processEvents()` and `self._update_ui()` before, during, and after dialog closure to ensure complete UI unblocking.
  - **Date**: 2023-07-25

- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (fourth attempt)
  - **Issue**: The UI would still remain blocked after confirming the progress dialog on the first import, despite previous fix attempts.
  - **Cause**: View transition timing issue - switching to Data view in `_finalize_loading` while dialog was still active created an event sequence conflict.
  - **Fix**: Moved view transition from `_finalize_loading` to `_close_progress_dialog` using a transition flag. This defers the view transition until after dialog is fully closed and all events processed, solving the timing conflict.
  - **Date**: 2023-07-31

- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (fifth attempt)
  - **Issue**: The UI was still occasionally becoming blocked after the first import despite previous fixes.
  - **Cause**: Even with delayed view transition via flag, there could still be timing issues between dialog closure and view transition events.
  - **Fix**: Implemented a timer-based delayed transition using QTimer.singleShot() to ensure all event processing completes before transition. Also added additional UI element re-enabling and more comprehensive event processing.
  - **Date**: 2023-07-31

- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (sixth attempt)
  - **Issue**: The UI blocking issue persisted despite multiple fix attempts.
  - **Cause**: The automatic view transition to the Data view after the first import was identified as unnecessary and a source of complexity causing timing issues.
  - **Fix**: Removed the view transition mechanism entirely while keeping the robust UI unblocking code. Added additional event processing and explicit UI element re-enabling to ensure full responsiveness.
  - **Date**: 2025-03-24
  - **Notes**: This simplification approach removes functionality that wasn't needed rather than adding more complexity to fix timing issues.

- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (seventh attempt)
  - **Issue**: Despite removing the view transition mechanism, the UI was still occasionally blocked after the first import.
  - **Cause**: Identified a race condition between the progress dialog closure and the DataView's table population process. The DataView temporarily disables its table during population, and our UI unblocking code might execute before the DataView re-enables the table at the end of its population process.
  - **Fix**: Implemented a two-phase UI unblocking approach:
    1. Immediate unblocking at dialog closure (existing code)
    2. Added a new delayed final check using QTimer.singleShot(500ms) that runs after all other processes are complete
    3. The delayed check ensures all UI elements are truly enabled after DataView has finished any table population
  - **Date**: 2025-03-24
  - **Notes**: This approach handles the timing issue without requiring changes to the DataView class or its internal table population process.

- ✅ UI remaining blocked after first import confirmation (eighth attempt)
  - **Issue**: The UI was still getting blocked after the first import despite previous fix attempts.
  - **Cause**: After detailed analysis, we found that the DataView's table population process is particularly lengthy during the first import (can take several seconds), and our single 500ms delayed check was not sufficient to catch the end of this process. On the first import, DataView temporarily disables the table while populating it in chunks, and our UI unblocking attempts were being overridden by the ongoing population process.
  - **Fix**: Implemented multiple delayed UI checks at increasing intervals:
    1. Kept the original 500ms check
    2. Added additional checks at 1500ms, 3000ms, and 5000ms
    3. Enhanced the check to explicitly re-enable all UI elements, not just the DataView table
    4. Added check to detect if DataView is still in the process of updating
    5. Improved logging to track when each check runs and what it finds
  - **Date**: 2025-03-24
  - **Notes**: This solution increases the chances of catching the end of the table population process, particularly for large datasets on the first import. The multiple checks at different intervals ensure we have multiple opportunities to re-enable the UI.

- ⚠️ UI still blocked after first import (major architectural redesign)
  - **Issue**: Despite multiple incremental fix attempts, the UI blocking issue after the first import persists.
  - **Cause**: Root analysis shows our approach of reactive patching has fundamental flaws. The real problems are:
    1. Lack of centralized UI state management
    2. Ad-hoc implementation of UI blocking/unblocking
    3. Reliance on timing and delayed checks (inherently fragile)
    4. No proper reference counting for blocking operations
    5. Mixed responsibilities in code (UI state mixed with business logic)
  - **Planned Solution**: Complete architectural redesign with a `UIStateManager` system that provides:
    1. Centralized tracking of which UI elements are blocked and why
    2. Reference counting for multiple operations blocking the same element
    3. Context manager for operations that might block the UI
    4. Proper element state tracking and restoration
    5. Thread-safe implementation for cross-thread operations
    6. Clear separation of UI state from business logic
  - **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach:
    1. Core components (UIStateManager, signals, contexts)
    2. MainWindow integration
    3. ProgressDialog integration
    4. DataView integration
    5. BackgroundWorker integration
    6. Comprehensive testing
    7. Documentation and finalization
  - **Date**: 2025-03-24
  - **Notes**: This represents a shift from reactive fixes to a proper architectural solution that addresses the underlying design issues rather than symptoms.

## Background Processing Issues
- ✅ Signal connections not working properly
  - Fixed connections between DataManager and MainWindow
  - Enhanced signal handling with proper debug logs
  - Improved DataManager._connect_signals() method

- ✅ Progress not updating during file load
  - Fixed by modifying the MultiCSVLoadTask to use a consistent scale
  - Implemented better file-specific progress reporting
  - Added overall progress updates at appropriate points

- ✅ Background worker cleanup issues
  - Improved thread cleanup in BackgroundWorker.__del__
  - Added better error handling for worker cleanup
  - Eliminated forced thread termination during shutdown

- **App crashes during CSV file import**: The application would crash in the middle of processing CSV files, particularly with large files.
  - Fixed by improving the memory management in `csv_service.py`, particularly the `read_csv_chunked` method which now incrementally processes chunks instead of storing all in memory.
  - Added robust error handling for memory errors, allowing partial data recovery.
  - Reduced UI update frequency in progress callbacks to prevent overwhelming the event queue.
  - Improved thread safety and signal handling for cross-thread communication.
  - Added proper resource cleanup and signal disconnection in the `BackgroundWorker` class.
  - Added safeguards against invalid configuration values like chunk size.

## Data Handling Issues
- ✅ ChestDataModel.update_data not notifying correctly
  - Fixed notification logic to ensure data changes are properly communicated
  - Added more detailed logging for debugging

# Remaining Issues

## Minor Issues
- QThread object deletion warning at shutdown
  - Non-critical issue related to Background Worker cleanup
  - Only occurs during application shutdown and doesn't affect functionality
  - Implemented a more graceful shutdown process to avoid thread termination
  - Improved warning messages to debug level to avoid alarming users

- **Memory usage during large file imports**: While improved, importing very large files still requires significant memory. 
  - Could be further improved by implementing disk-based intermediate storage for extremely large datasets.

## Lessons Learned

1. Signal connections require careful debugging to ensure they're properly connected and functioning
2. Progress reporting should have consistent scales and clear distinction between file-specific and overall progress
3. The Qt progress dialog requires explicit visibility commands in some cases
4. Background task error handling is critical for preventing crashes during file operations
5. Debug logging in key methods greatly assists troubleshooting complex interaction issues
6. Thread cleanup during application shutdown requires special handling to avoid errors
7. Tracking state in a dedicated dictionary (_loading_state) provides more consistent UI updates
8. Processing events (QApplication.processEvents()) is important for responsive UI updates during file operations
9. Check Python files for syntax errors such as extraneous code block markers (```) or incorrect indentation
10. Verify color constants and other resources exist before using them in UI components
11. Keep import paths consistent with actual project structure

- **Memory Management Patterns**: Accumulating chunks of data in memory can lead to crashes with large files. Instead:
  - Process data incrementally where possible
  - Implement early exit strategies for memory errors
  - Add progress throttling to reduce overhead
  - Consider using disk-based intermediate storage for very large datasets

- **Signal Safety**: When working with signals across threads:
  - Use robust error handling around every signal emission
  - Implement throttling for high-frequency progress updates
  - Always disconnect signals when done to prevent memory leaks
  - Use try/except blocks around Qt object interactions that might be deleted

## Persistent Issues

### UI Blocking After First Import
- **Status**: 🟡 In Progress - Comprehensive redesign in progress
- **Description**: The UI, especially the data table, remains blocked after the first import operation completes.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - Multiple attempts to fix with timing-based solutions have been unsuccessful
  - The fundamental issue appears to be how UI blocking/unblocking is managed throughout the application
  - Current approach uses ad-hoc timing-sensitive code with multiple calls to QApplication.processEvents()
  - There's no centralized tracking of which elements are blocked and by which operations
  - Potential threading issues between background worker and UI thread
- **Solution Attempts**:
  1. ❌ First attempt: Added processEvents() calls after dialog closure
  2. ❌ Second attempt: Added manual enabling of table view
  3. ❌ Third attempt: Added multiple phases of UI unblocking
  4. ❌ Fourth attempt: Added explicit checks for data view table
  5. ❌ Fifth attempt: Added delayed UI checks
  6. ❌ Sixth attempt: Removed automatic view transition
  7. ❌ Seventh attempt: Added two-phase UI unblocking (immediate + delayed)
