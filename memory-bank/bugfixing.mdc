#### Memory leak during data processing (2025-02-05)
- **Issue:** Memory usage increasing significantly during data processing
- **Cause:** Large data structures not being properly released
- **Fix:** Implemented improved memory management and added explicit garbage collection

#### Export functionality producing incorrect formats (2025-02-10)
- **Issue:** Exported files not matching expected formats
- **Cause:** Format specification issues in the export module
- **Fix:** Corrected format specifications and added validation for exported files

### Background Processing Issues

#### Background tasks not completing (2025-02-15)
- **Issue:** Background tasks sometimes fail to complete
- **Cause:** Issues with the task queue management
- **Fix:** Enhanced task queue with better monitoring and timeout handling

#### Progress reporting inconsistent (2025-02-20)
- **Issue:** Progress updates not reflecting actual task completion
- **Cause:** Progress calculation not accounting for all subtasks
- **Fix:** Improved progress calculation algorithm and added more detailed reporting

#### Background worker thread crashes (2025-02-25)
- **Issue:** Background worker threads occasionally crashing
- **Cause:** Unhandled exceptions in worker threads
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive exception handling in worker threads and better logging

#### UI remaining blocked after operations (2025-03-01)
- **Issue:** UI elements remaining disabled after operations complete
- **Cause:** Missing cleanup code in exception paths
- **Fix:** Implemented UI State Management System with proper reference counting and cleanup

## Ongoing Issues

### UI Blocking After First Import

#### Description
After the first CSV import operation, the UI (especially the data table view) remains blocked even though the import operation has completed. This prevents users from interacting with the imported data.

#### Investigation Progress
1. Initial testing showed that the UI blocking occurs specifically after the first import
2. Timing-based solutions have been attempted but do not consistently resolve the issue
3. Root cause appears to be a fundamental issue with how UI blocking/unblocking is managed
4. UI State Management System is being implemented to address this issue systematically
5. MainWindow integration with UI State Management System completed
6. Test fixes for UI components completed (WelcomeStateWidget, RecentFilesList)
7. Remaining tests to fix for MainWindow UI State

#### Current Solution in Progress
Implementing a comprehensive UI State Management system that:
- Tracks which UI elements are blocked by which operations
- Maintains reference counts for nested operations
- Provides thread-safe access to UI state
- Notifies elements of state changes automatically

### Memory Usage During Large File Imports

#### Description
The application uses excessive memory when importing large CSV files, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors on systems with limited resources.

#### Investigation Progress
1. Profiling shows that large data structures are being loaded entirely into memory
2. Initial chunking implementation helps but does not fully resolve the issue
3. Need to implement more efficient data structures and stream processing

#### Potential Solutions
1. Implement stream processing for file imports
2. Add memory usage monitoring and throttling
3. Implement data paging for large datasets
4. Optimize data structures to reduce memory footprint

## Lessons Learned

### UI Components
1. Always ensure proper signal connections for UI state changes
2. Implement comprehensive testing for UI component visibility states
3. Use explicit show/hide calls rather than relying on implicit behavior
4. Carefully test edge cases like empty states and error conditions

### Threading
1. Always ensure proper cleanup of UI blocking operations, even in error paths
2. Use a systematic approach to track UI state across thread boundaries
3. Implement proper synchronization for shared resources
4. Never make assumptions about timing between UI and background threads

### Testing
1. Create proper mocks for complex UI components
2. Avoid using real UI classes with metaclass inheritance in tests
3. Test visibility states explicitly, checking both properties and actual visibility
4. Handle signal emissions carefully, checking actual values rather than constants

### Performance
1. Monitor memory usage during large data operations
2. Implement chunked processing for large datasets
3. Use background processing for CPU-intensive operations
4. Optimize data structures for specific use cases

## Next Steps

### UI State Management
