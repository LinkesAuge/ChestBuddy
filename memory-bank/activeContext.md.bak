# Active Context: ChestBuddy Application

## Current State

The application architecture is stable with all core functionality implemented. The application has successfully transitioned to a controller-based architecture, with all UI components now using the appropriate controllers for business logic operations. 

We have implemented a SignalManager utility to centralize and improve signal connection management, including throttling capabilities to improve UI performance with rapidly firing signals.

# Active Context: ChestBuddy Application

## Current State

The ChestBuddy application architecture is now fully complete and stable. All core functionality is implemented and working properly. The application has successfully transitioned to a controller-based architecture with proper separation of concerns.

We have fully implemented the SignalManager utility with all planned features, including signal throttling, prioritized connections, type checking, and the safe connection methods. All phases of the Signal Connection Management Improvement Plan are now complete (Phases 1-6).

### Completed Signal Connection Management Improvements

We have successfully completed the Signal Connection Management Improvement Plan:

1. Created a robust `SignalManager` utility for managing PySide6 signal connections:

   - Methods to prevent duplicate connections
   - Centralized disconnection methods
   - Support for debugging and connection management
   - Parameter compatibility checking
   - Prioritized connections
   - Safe connection methods with automatic disconnection
   - Signal blocking context manager

2. Established signal connection standards across the codebase:
   - Consistent naming patterns for signal handlers
   - Error handling patterns
   - Documentation requirements
   - Testing approaches
   
3. Implemented signal throttling to improve performance
   - Configurable throttle intervals

### Application Architecture

The application architecture follows a clean controller-based organization:

1. **Core Layer**:
   - Models: ChestDataModel, ValidationModel
   - Services: CSVService, ValidationService, CorrectionService, ChartService
   - Controllers: FileOperationsController, ProgressController, ErrorHandlingController, ViewStateController, DataViewController, UIStateController

2. **UI Layer**:
   - MainWindow: Main application window (delegates to controllers)
   - Views: Dashboard, Data, Validation, Correction, Charts

3. **Utils Layer**:
   - Configuration
   - Logging
   - File operations helpers
   - **SignalManager**: Utility for signal connection management
   - **Signal Standards**: Reference for signal naming and connection patterns

### Current UI Navigation

The navigation system uses a sidebar that provides access to:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of data and recent files
2. **Data**: Tabular view of imported data
3. **Validation**: View and resolve validation issues
4. **Correction**: Apply automated corrections to data
5. **Charts**: Visualize data in various chart formats

### Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets (>100,000 rows) can consume significant memory
2. **UI Performance**: While signal throttling has improved the situation, updates to the UI thread can still cause momentary freezing with very large datasets
3. **Thread Cleanup**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown (non-critical)
4. **Controller Tests**: Some controller tests that require QApplication need to be updated to use pytest-qt

### Column Name Standardization

The application supports diverse CSV file formats through:

- Column name mapping to standardize input data (using `EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]`)
- Case-insensitive comparison for column identification
- Regular expression patterns for fuzzy matching similar columns
- Default column templates for easy mapping

## Signal Management Architecture

The SignalManager and signal connection system now includes throttling capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    SM[SignalManager] --> RC[Regular Connections]
    SM --> TC[Throttled Connections]
    SM --> CB[Context Managers]
    SM --> UT[Utility Methods]
    
    RC --> CT[Connection Tracking]
    RC --> CD[Connection Debugging]

    DM -->|Waits for quiet period| SR
    
    CB --> BS[Blocked Signals]
    UT --> SC[Safe Connect]
    UT --> IS[Is Connected]
    UT --> GC[Get Connections]
    
    style SM fill:#2C5282,color:#fff
    style TC fill:#1E3A5F,color:#fff
    style TM fill:#1E3A5F,color:#fff
    style DM fill:#1E3A5F,color:#fff
```

The throttling functionality supports two modes:
1. **Throttle Mode**: First event fires immediately, then ignores events until the timer expires
2. **Debounce Mode**: Waits for events to stop coming in before firing, using the most recent values
