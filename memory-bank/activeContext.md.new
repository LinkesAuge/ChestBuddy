# Active Context: ChestBuddy Application

## Current State

The ChestBuddy application architecture is now fully complete and stable. All core functionality is implemented and working properly. The application has successfully transitioned to a controller-based architecture with proper separation of concerns.

We have fully implemented the SignalManager utility with all planned features, including signal throttling, prioritized connections, type checking, and the safe connection methods. All phases of the Signal Connection Management Improvement Plan are now complete (Phases 1-6).

### Completed Signal Connection Management Improvements

We have successfully completed the Signal Connection Management Improvement Plan:

1. Created a robust `SignalManager` utility for managing PySide6 signal connections:
   - Centralized connection tracking
   - Methods to prevent duplicate connections
   - Centralized disconnection methods
   - Support for debugging and connection management
   - Parameter compatibility checking
   - Prioritized connections
   - Safe connection methods with automatic disconnection
   - Signal blocking context manager

2. Established signal connection standards across the codebase:
   - Consistent naming patterns for signal handlers
   - Error handling patterns
   - Documentation requirements
   - Testing approaches
   
3. Implemented signal throttling to improve performance
   - Configurable throttle intervals
   - Support for both throttling and debouncing modes
   - Proper cleanup of throttled connections

### Application Architecture

The application architecture follows a clean controller-based organization:

1. **Core Layer**:
   - Models: ChestDataModel, ValidationModel
   - Services: CSVService, ValidationService, CorrectionService, ChartService
   - Controllers: FileOperationsController, ProgressController, ErrorHandlingController, ViewStateController, DataViewController, UIStateController

2. **UI Layer**:
   - MainWindow: Main application window (delegates to controllers)
   - Views: Dashboard, Data, Validation, Correction, Charts

3. **Utils Layer**:
   - Configuration
   - Logging
   - File operations helpers
   - **SignalManager**: Utility for signal connection management
   - **Signal Standards**: Reference for signal naming and connection patterns

### Current UI Navigation

The navigation system uses a sidebar that provides access to:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of data and recent files
2. **Data**: Tabular view of imported data
3. **Validation**: View and resolve validation issues
4. **Correction**: Apply automated corrections to data
5. **Charts**: Visualize data in various chart formats

### Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets (>100,000 rows) can consume significant memory
2. **UI Performance**: While signal throttling has improved the situation, updates to the UI thread can still cause momentary freezing with very large datasets
3. **Thread Cleanup**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown (non-critical)
4. **Controller Tests**: Some controller tests that require QApplication need to be updated to use pytest-qt

### Column Name Standardization

The application supports diverse CSV file formats through:

- Column name mapping to standardize input data (using `EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]`)
- Case-insensitive comparison for column identification
- Regular expression patterns for fuzzy matching similar columns
- Default column templates for easy mapping

## Application Architecture

The current application architecture follows these patterns:
