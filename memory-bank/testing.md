# ChestBuddy Testing Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing framework implemented for the ChestBuddy application. The framework provides a structured approach to testing different components and interactions within the application, ensuring code quality and reliability.

## Test Directory Structure

The testing framework follows a structured layout:

```
tests/
├── unit/               # Tests for individual components in isolation
├── integration/        # Tests for component interactions
├── ui/                 # Tests for UI components
├── e2e/                # End-to-end workflow tests
├── data/               # Test data factories and datasets
├── utils/              # Testing utilities and helpers
├── resources/          # Test resources and assets
├── conftest.py         # Common test fixtures
├── pytest.ini          # Pytest configuration
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Focus on testing individual components in isolation
- Fast execution with minimal dependencies
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Current status: Working correctly

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between multiple components
- Medium execution speed
- Less mocking, more real component interaction
- Current status: Experiencing recursion issues with signal handling (work in progress)

### UI Tests
- Test UI components and user interactions
- Use QtBot for widget testing
- Test both appearance and behavior
- Current status: Working correctly

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete application workflows
- Slow execution, but comprehensive coverage
- Minimal mocking, focused on real usage scenarios
- Current status: Experiencing issues with test execution (work in progress)

## Key Testing Tools & Frameworks

### Core Testing Framework
- Pytest as the primary testing framework
- Pytest-qt for Qt widget testing
- Pytest-cov for test coverage reporting

### Special Test Features
- Custom SignalSpy for monitoring Qt signals
- Enhanced QtBot for improved widget testing
- TestDataFactory for generating test datasets

## Test Fixtures

The framework includes several fixtures defined in `conftest.py`:

1. **QtBot Enhanced**: Extended version of qtbot with additional helper methods
2. **Main Window**: Factory for creating MainWindow instances for testing
3. **Sample Data**: Pre-generated datasets of various sizes and characteristics
4. **Temporary Files**: Fixtures for temporary file/directory management
5. **Mock Services**: Pre-configured service mocks for different testing scenarios

## Test Patterns

### Widget Testing Pattern
```python
def test_widget_functionality(qtbot):
    # Create widget
    widget = SomeWidget()
    qtbot.addWidget(widget)
    
    # Set up signal spy
    signal_spy = SignalSpy(widget.some_signal)
    
    # Perform action
    qtbot.mouseClick(widget.button, Qt.LeftButton)
    
    # Verify results
    assert signal_spy.count() == 1
    assert widget.property("value") == expected_value
```

### Integration Testing Pattern
```python
def test_component_interaction(service_mock, controller_mock):
    # Set up test scenario
    service_mock.return_value = expected_data
    
    # Create components
    component_a = ComponentA(service_mock)
    component_b = ComponentB(component_a, controller_mock)
    
    # Perform action
    component_b.process_data()
    
    # Verify results
    service_mock.assert_called_once()
    controller_mock.update.assert_called_with(expected_result)
```

## Known Issues

1. **Recursion with Complex Data Structures**: Integration tests experience recursion issues when using PySide6 signals with pandas DataFrames. This is likely due to how Qt serializes complex Python objects when emitting signals.

2. **Signal Cleanup**: Some tests may leak signal connections, leading to unexpected behavior in subsequent tests. A more robust signal cleanup mechanism is needed.

3. **Event Loop Management**: Tests involving multiple signal emissions may have timing issues related to the Qt event loop processing.

## Best Practices

1. **Isolated Tests**: Each test should be completely isolated and not depend on the state from previous tests.

2. **Clean Setup and Teardown**: Always clean up resources (files, connections, etc.) after tests.

3. **Meaningful Assertions**: Make assertions that verify the actual functionality, not just implementation details.

4. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services, I/O operations, and other dependencies.

5. **Test Data Management**: Use the TestDataFactory for consistent test data rather than creating ad-hoc data in each test.

## Qt UI Testing Best Practices

1. **Widget Registration**: Always register widgets with qtbot using `qtbot.addWidget(widget)`.

2. **Signal Verification**: Use SignalSpy to verify signal emissions rather than relying on side effects.

3. **Event Processing**: Use `qtbot.waitForWindowShown(widget)` before interacting with newly created widgets.

4. **Event Timing**: Use `qtbot.waitUntil()` for asynchronous operations instead of fixed delays.

5. **Modal Dialog Testing**: Use `qtbot.waitForWindow()` for testing modal dialogs.

## Future Improvements

1. **Simplify Data Structures**: Replace complex pandas DataFrames with simpler data structures for integration tests to avoid recursion issues.

2. **Enhanced Signal Management**: Implement better signal connection tracking and cleanup.

3. **Improved Event Loop Handling**: Develop more sophisticated tools for managing the Qt event loop in tests.

4. **Expanded Test Coverage**: Increase coverage for all components, especially edge cases and error scenarios.

5. **Performance Optimizations**: Improve test execution speed, particularly for UI and end-to-end tests.
