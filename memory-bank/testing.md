# ChestBuddy Testing Documentation

This document provides an overview of the testing approach used in the ChestBuddy application, including how to use the tests, what they test, and how they are implemented.

## Testing Philosophy

The ChestBuddy application follows a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: New features are developed by writing tests first, then implementing the functionality to pass those tests.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios.
3. **Automated Testing**: All tests are automated and can be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
4. **Performance Testing**: Critical components are benchmarked and tested for performance.
5. **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.

## Final Testing Status

As of project completion, all testing components are fully implemented and passing. The comprehensive test suite includes:

- **Unit Tests**: 100% complete, with coverage for all core components
- **Integration Tests**: 100% complete, verifying the interaction between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: 100% complete, covering key user workflows
- **UI Tests**: 100% complete, testing UI components and interactions

### Validation System Testing

The validation system integration has been fully tested with:

1. **Unit Tests for UIStateController**: Testing validation state tracking, action state management, and response to validation results.

2. **Integration Tests**: Verifying proper communication between UIStateController, DataViewController, and ValidationService.

3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing the complete validation workflow from data import to validation result visualization and user interactions.

4. **Test Scripts**: Created dedicated test scripts (`run_validation_tests.sh` and `run_validation_tests.bat`) to run all validation-related tests and verify the validation workflow integration.

All tests are now passing, confirming the proper implementation and integration of the validation system.

## Test Directory Structure

The ChestBuddy application uses a comprehensive test structure to ensure code quality and functionality:

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- **Model Tests**: Verify data structures and behaviors
- **Service Tests**: Verify business logic
- **Controller Tests**: Verify control flow and coordination
- **UI Component Tests**: Verify UI component behavior

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between components:

- **Controller-Service Integration**: Verify controllers interact correctly with services
- **UI-Controller Integration**: Verify UI components interact correctly with controllers
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Verify complete application workflows

### Performance Tests

Performance tests measure the efficiency of critical operations:

- **CSV Import Performance**: Measure CSV loading performance with large files
- **Data Processing Performance**: Measure data processing efficiency
- **Chart Rendering Performance**: Measure chart generation performance

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/core/test_chest_data_model.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/unit/core/test_chest_data_model.py::test_update_data

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=chestbuddy

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Test Discovery

PyTest automatically discovers tests:
- Files matching `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Functions prefixed with `test_`
- Classes prefixed with `Test` containing methods prefixed with `test_`

### Test Result Interpretation

Test results will show:
- Passing tests (.)
- Failing tests (F)
- Tests with errors (E)
- Skipped tests (s)
- Warnings (W)

## Key Testing Tools & Frameworks

The ChestBuddy application uses the following test tools and frameworks:

1. **pytest**: The primary testing framework for running tests and assertions.
2. **pytest-qt**: For testing Qt/PySide6 components.
3. **pytest-cov**: For measuring test coverage.
4. **pytest-mock**: For mocking dependencies.
5. **pandas testing utilities**: For testing DataFrame operations.

## Special Test Features

### Qt Testing

For testing Qt components:
```python
def test_ui_component(qtbot):
    # Create component
    widget = MyWidget()
    qtbot.addWidget(widget)
    
    # Simulate user interactions
    qtbot.mouseClick(widget.button, Qt.LeftButton)
    
    # Verify results
    assert widget.label.text() == "Expected Text"
```

### Signal Testing

For testing PySide6 signals:
```python
def test_signal_emission(qtbot):
    # Create component that emits signals
    component = MyComponent()
    
    # Create spy to monitor signal
    with qtbot.waitSignal(component.my_signal, timeout=1000) as blocker:
        # Trigger the signal
        component.do_something()
    
    # Verify signal was emitted with expected arguments
    assert blocker.args == [expected_value]
```

### Mock Objects

For replacing dependencies in tests:
```python
def test_with_mocks(mocker):
    # Create mock
    mock_service = mocker.MagicMock()
    mock_service.get_data.return_value = test_data
    
    # Inject mock
    controller = Controller(service=mock_service)
    
    # Test behavior
    result = controller.process()
    
    # Verify expectations
    assert result == expected_result
    mock_service.get_data.assert_called_once()
```

## Common Test Fixtures

ChestBuddy tests use several reusable fixtures:

### Application Fixture
```python
@pytest.fixture
def app(qtbot):
    """Create a QApplication instance."""
    app = QApplication.instance() or QApplication([])
    yield app
```

### Model Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def chest_data_model():
    """Create a ChestDataModel with sample data."""
    model = ChestDataModel()
    model.update_data(sample_data)
    return model
```

### Controller Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def data_view_controller(chest_data_model, signal_manager):
    """Create a DataViewController with dependencies."""
    return DataViewController(chest_data_model, signal_manager)
```

### Service Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def validation_service():
    """Create a ValidationService instance."""
    return ValidationService()
```

## Test Patterns

### Setup-Execute-Assert Pattern

Most tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:
```python
def test_component_behavior():
    # Arrange
    component = Component()
    expected_result = "expected_value"
    
    # Act
    actual_result = component.do_something()
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

### Dependency Injection

Components are tested with injected dependencies:
```python
def test_controller_with_injected_dependencies():
    # Create mock dependencies
    mock_model = MockModel()
    mock_service = MockService()
    
    # Inject dependencies
    controller = Controller(model=mock_model, service=mock_service)
    
    # Test the controller
    controller.process()
    
    # Verify interactions with dependencies
    assert mock_model.update.called
    assert mock_service.validate.called
```

## Specialized Test Cases

### SignalManager Tests

Tests for the SignalManager verify:
- Signal connections are properly tracked
- Duplicate connections are prevented
- Signal disconnections work correctly
- Throttling and debouncing function as expected
- Safe connections with type checking work properly

### UpdateManager Tests

Tests for the UpdateManager verify:
- Components are updated correctly
- Updates are properly scheduled
- Dependencies between components are respected
- Batching and debouncing work as expected

### DataState Tracking Tests

Tests for the DataState tracking system verify:
- Data changes are properly detected
- Components are updated based on relevant changes
- Performance is optimized for large datasets

## Writing New Tests

When writing new tests:

1. **Follow Naming Conventions**:
   - Test files: `test_<component_name>.py`
   - Test functions: `test_<functionality_being_tested>`
   - Test classes: `Test<ComponentName>`

2. **Isolate Dependencies**:
   - Use mocks or test doubles for dependencies
   - Inject dependencies rather than creating them inside components

3. **Use Fixtures for Common Setup**:
   - Create fixtures for reusable test components
   - Use fixture composition for complex setups

4. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**:
   - Focus on what the component does, not how it does it
   - Avoid over-mocking which can make tests brittle

5. **Follow the AAA Pattern**:
   - Arrange: Set up the test scenario
   - Act: Execute the functionality being tested
   - Assert: Verify the expected outcomes

6. **Include Edge Cases**:
   - Test empty/null inputs
   - Test boundary conditions
   - Test error handling

## Common Test Scenarios

### Testing Signal Connections

```python
def test_signal_connections(qtbot):
    # Create components
    model = ChestDataModel()
    controller = DataViewController(model)
    
    # Set up signal spy
    with qtbot.waitSignal(controller.data_validated, timeout=1000) as blocker:
        # Trigger the signal chain
        model.data_changed.emit()
    
    # Verify the signal was emitted with correct data
    assert blocker.args[0]['valid'] is True
```

### Testing UI Updates

```python
def test_ui_updates(qtbot):
    # Create view component
    view = DataViewAdapter()
    qtbot.addWidget(view)
    
    # Update data
    view.update_data(new_data)
    
    # Verify UI was updated
    assert view.table.rowCount() == len(new_data)
    assert view.table.item(0, 0).text() == str(new_data.iloc[0, 0])
```

### Testing Data Processing

```python
def test_data_processing():
    # Create service
    service = CSVService()
    
    # Process data
    result = service.process_data(test_data)
    
    # Verify results
    pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(result, expected_result)
```

## Performance Testing

Performance tests verify that the application performs efficiently:

```python
def test_large_dataset_performance():
    # Create large dataset
    large_data = create_large_dataset(100000)
    
    # Measure time for operation
    start_time = time.time()
    result = service.process_data(large_data)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Verify performance is acceptable
    assert duration < 1.0  # Operation should complete in under 1 second
```

## Test Mocks and Fakes

ChestBuddy uses several mock components for testing:

1. **MockDataManager**: Simulates the DataManager for testing controllers.
2. **MockUpdatableComponent**: Implements the IUpdatable interface for testing UpdateManager.
3. **MockValidationService**: Simulates validation for testing DataViewController.
4. **MockSignalReceiver**: Helps test signal emissions and connections.

## Debugging Tests

When tests fail:

1. **Use Verbose Output**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py
   ```

2. **Print Debug Information**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py --capture=no
   ```

3. **Debug Specific Test**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py::test_function_name --pdb
   ```

4. **Show Local Variables**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py --showlocals
   ```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. All tests run on each pull request.
2. Code coverage is reported.
3. Performance benchmarks are tracked over time.
4. Test failures block merging of pull requests.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Tests Fast**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing.
2. **Keep Tests Independent**: Tests should not depend on other tests or external state.
3. **Make Tests Readable**: Tests should clearly communicate what they're testing.
4. **Test One Thing at a Time**: Each test should focus on a single aspect of behavior.
5. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Names should describe what the test verifies.
6. **Keep Test Code Clean**: Apply the same code quality standards to tests as production code.
7. **Don't Test Framework Code**: Focus on testing your application code, not third-party libraries.
8. **Test Both Success and Failure Cases**: Verify how components handle errors and edge cases.

## Recent Test Improvements

1. **SignalTracer Integration Tests**: Added comprehensive tests for signal flow visualization.
2. **Data State Tracking Tests**: Enhanced tests for data dependency tracking and optimization.
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Added tests to measure performance with large datasets.
4. **Memory Usage Tests**: Added tests to track memory consumption patterns.

## Recent Testing Insights (March 26, 2024)

### Qt UI Testing Best Practices

Based on our recent experience with fixing validation UI component tests, here are some best practices for testing Qt UI components:

1. **Avoid Direct Event Simulation**: Instead of using `QTest.mouseClick()` or other event simulation methods, which can be unreliable in test environments, directly call the underlying methods or set properties.

2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Always mock external dependencies like services to isolate the UI component being tested.

3. **Reset Mocks When Needed**: When testing signal emission, be sure to reset mocks before the expected signal emission to avoid counting previous calls.

4. **Skip Problematic Tests When Necessary**: If a test can't be reliably implemented due to test environment limitations (like context menu testing), consider skipping it with a clear explanation.

5. **Use Direct Method Calls for Signal Handlers**: Call signal handler methods directly rather than trying to emit signals from other components, which can be unreliable in tests.

6. **Test State, Not Implementation**: Focus tests on verifying that the component is in the correct state after an action, rather than on the specific implementation details.

7. **Handle Qt's Signal/Slot Threading Issues**: Be aware that signals may not be processed immediately in tests, so use techniques like `QTest.qWait()` when necessary.

8. **Separate UI Tests from Logic Tests**: Keep UI component tests focused on UI behavior and separately test the underlying logic.

### Common Test Failures and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Qt events not registering | Directly call event handlers |
| Mocked methods called multiple times | Reset mocks before the expected call |
| Signal emission failures | Directly call the method that emits the signal |
| Context menu testing issues | Mock the menu creation/execution process |
| Path resolution problems | Use absolute paths or mock filesystem interactions |
| Thread safety issues | Use signal blocking where appropriate and add small waits |

## Conclusion

The testing approach in ChestBuddy ensures high code quality and reliability. By following the patterns and practices described in this document, you can maintain and extend the test suite to support ongoing development.

## Best Practices for Testing Qt UI Components

After fixing issues in our validation component tests, we've established the following best practices for testing Qt UI components:

### 1. Component Isolation

- **Use Mocks for Dependencies**: Create mock objects for services, models, and other dependencies
  ```python
  # Create mock service for testing
  mock_service = MagicMock(spec=ValidationService)
  ```

- **Inject Dependencies**: Pass dependencies to components rather than creating them internally
  ```python
  # Create component with injected mock
  component = ValidationListView("Test", mock_model)
  ```

- **Test in Isolation**: Test each component individually before testing interactions

### 2. Direct Method Testing Over Event Simulation

- **Call Handler Methods Directly**: Instead of simulating UI events, call handler methods directly
  ```python
  # Instead of: QTest.mouseClick(view.add_button, Qt.MouseButton.LeftButton)
  # Call directly:
  view._on_add_clicked()
  ```

- **Set Properties Directly**: Set widget properties directly rather than through UI interactions
  ```python
  # Instead of simulating typing, set text directly
  view.search_input.setText("TestSearch")
  ```

- **Focus on Behavior Testing**: Test the behavior rather than the event handling mechanism

### 3. Mock Reset Before Verification

- **Reset Mocks Before Actions**: Clear previous calls from mocks before the action being tested
  ```python
  # Reset mock before action
  mock_validate.reset_mock()
  # Perform action
  view._on_validate_now()
  # Verify mock was called once
  mock_validate.assert_called_once()
  ```

- **Avoid Counting Setup Calls**: This prevents counting calls from setup or previous operations
- **Especially Important for Signal Handlers**: Signal handlers may be called during initialization

### 4. Signal-Slot Testing Strategies

- **Use Direct Signal Emission**: Emit signals directly for testing
  ```python
  # Emit signal directly
  view.validation_updated.emit()
  ```

- **Add Wait Time for Signal Processing**: Allow time for signal processing
  ```python
  # Allow time for signal processing
  QTest.qWait(50)
  ```

- **Verify Signal Arguments**: Check that signals emit with expected arguments
  ```python
  args = signal_spy.call_args[0]
  assert args[0] == expected_category
  assert args[1] == expected_count
  ```

### 5. Context Menu Testing

- **Mock QMenu**: Create a mock QMenu instead of using real menu
  ```python
  # Create a mock QMenu
  mock_menu = MagicMock(spec=QMenu)
  # Patch QMenu constructor
  monkeypatch.setattr(QMenu, "__new__", lambda cls, *args, **kwargs: mock_menu)
  ```

- **Call Menu Methods Directly**: Call context menu methods directly
  ```python
  # Call context menu method directly
  view._show_context_menu(position)
  ```

- **Verify Menu Interactions**: Check that menu actions were added and menu was executed
  ```python
  assert mock_menu.addAction.call_count >= 1
  mock_menu.exec.assert_called_once()
  ```

### 6. Test Environment Setup

- **Use Unique Test Data**: Create unique test data for each test
  ```python
  # Create unique validation directory for each test
  test_id = id(test_dataframe)
  validation_dir = tmp_path / f"validation_{test_id}"
  ```

- **Clean Up After Tests**: Reset state or clean up resources after each test
  ```python
  # In fixture teardown
  service._reset_for_testing()
  ```

- **Use Explicit Setup and Teardown**: Make setup and teardown explicit in test fixtures

By following these practices, we ensure more reliable and maintainable tests for Qt UI components.
