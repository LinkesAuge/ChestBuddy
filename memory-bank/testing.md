# ChestBuddy Testing Documentation

This document provides an overview of the testing approach used in the ChestBuddy application, including how to use the tests, what they test, and how they are implemented.

## Testing Philosophy

The ChestBuddy application follows a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: New features are developed by writing tests first, then implementing the functionality to pass those tests.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios.
3. **Automated Testing**: All tests are automated and can be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
4. **Performance Testing**: Critical components are benchmarked and tested for performance.
5. **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.

## Test Directory Structure

Tests are organized in the `tests` directory with the following structure:

```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py                  # Common pytest fixtures
├── unit/                        # Unit tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── core/                    # Tests for core components
│   ├── ui/                      # Tests for UI components

└── fixtures/                    # Test data and fixtures
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── sample_data.csv
    └── ...
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

1. **Model Tests**: Verify the behavior of data models like `ChestDataModel`.
2. **Service Tests**: Validate service classes like `ValidationService`, `CSVService`, etc.
3. **Controller Tests**: Ensure controllers like `FileOperationsController`, `DataViewController`, etc. function correctly.
4. **Utility Tests**: Test utility classes like `SignalManager`, `ServiceLocator`, `UpdateManager`, etc.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components:

1. **Controller-View Integration**: Test that controllers interact correctly with views.
2. **Service-Model Integration**: Verify services work correctly with data models.
3. **Signal-Slot Integration**: Test that signal connections work as expected across components.
4. **Data Flow Tests**: Ensure data flows correctly through the system.

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests validate complete user workflows:

1. **Data Import-Export**: Test the full cycle of importing, processing, and exporting data.
2. **Validation-Correction Flow**: Test the workflow of validating and correcting data issues.
3. **UI Navigation**: Test navigation between different views and components.

### Performance Tests

Performance tests benchmark critical operations:

1. **Large Dataset Tests**: Verify performance with large datasets.
2. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure UI remains responsive during heavy operations.
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption patterns.

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/core/test_chest_data_model.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/unit/core/test_chest_data_model.py::test_update_data

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=chestbuddy

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Test Discovery

PyTest automatically discovers tests:
- Files matching `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Functions prefixed with `test_`
- Classes prefixed with `Test` containing methods prefixed with `test_`

### Test Result Interpretation

Test results will show:
- Passing tests (.)
- Failing tests (F)
- Tests with errors (E)
- Skipped tests (s)
- Warnings (W)

## Key Testing Tools & Frameworks

The ChestBuddy application uses the following test tools and frameworks:

1. **pytest**: The primary testing framework for running tests and assertions.
2. **pytest-qt**: For testing Qt/PySide6 components.
3. **pytest-cov**: For measuring test coverage.
4. **pytest-mock**: For mocking dependencies.
5. **pandas testing utilities**: For testing DataFrame operations.

## Special Test Features

### Qt Testing

For testing Qt components:
```python
def test_ui_component(qtbot):
    # Create component
    widget = MyWidget()
    qtbot.addWidget(widget)
    
    # Simulate user interactions
    qtbot.mouseClick(widget.button, Qt.LeftButton)
    
    # Verify results
    assert widget.label.text() == "Expected Text"
```

### Signal Testing

For testing PySide6 signals:
```python
def test_signal_emission(qtbot):
    # Create component that emits signals
    component = MyComponent()
    
    # Create spy to monitor signal
    with qtbot.waitSignal(component.my_signal, timeout=1000) as blocker:
        # Trigger the signal
        component.do_something()
    
    # Verify signal was emitted with expected arguments
    assert blocker.args == [expected_value]
```

### Mock Objects

For replacing dependencies in tests:
```python
def test_with_mocks(mocker):
    # Create mock
    mock_service = mocker.MagicMock()
    mock_service.get_data.return_value = test_data
    
    # Inject mock
    controller = Controller(service=mock_service)
    
    # Test behavior
    result = controller.process()
    
    # Verify expectations
    assert result == expected_result
    mock_service.get_data.assert_called_once()
```

## Common Test Fixtures

ChestBuddy tests use several reusable fixtures:

### Application Fixture
```python
@pytest.fixture
def app(qtbot):
    """Create a QApplication instance."""
    app = QApplication.instance() or QApplication([])
    yield app
```

### Model Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def chest_data_model():
    """Create a ChestDataModel with sample data."""
    model = ChestDataModel()
    model.update_data(sample_data)
    return model
```

### Controller Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def data_view_controller(chest_data_model, signal_manager):
    """Create a DataViewController with dependencies."""
    return DataViewController(chest_data_model, signal_manager)
```

### Service Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def validation_service():
    """Create a ValidationService instance."""
    return ValidationService()
```

## Test Patterns

### Setup-Execute-Assert Pattern

Most tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:
```python
def test_component_behavior():
    # Arrange
    component = Component()
    expected_result = "expected_value"
    
    # Act
    actual_result = component.do_something()
    
    # Assert
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

### Dependency Injection

Components are tested with injected dependencies:
```python
def test_controller_with_injected_dependencies():
    # Create mock dependencies
    mock_model = MockModel()
    mock_service = MockService()
    
    # Inject dependencies
    controller = Controller(model=mock_model, service=mock_service)
    
    # Test the controller
    controller.process()
    
    # Verify interactions with dependencies
    assert mock_model.update.called
    assert mock_service.validate.called
```

## Specialized Test Cases

### SignalManager Tests

Tests for the SignalManager verify:
- Signal connections are properly tracked
- Duplicate connections are prevented
- Signal disconnections work correctly
- Throttling and debouncing function as expected
- Safe connections with type checking work properly

### UpdateManager Tests

Tests for the UpdateManager verify:
- Components are updated correctly
- Updates are properly scheduled
- Dependencies between components are respected
- Batching and debouncing work as expected

### DataState Tracking Tests

Tests for the DataState tracking system verify:
- Data changes are properly detected
- Components are updated based on relevant changes
- Performance is optimized for large datasets

## Writing New Tests

When writing new tests:

1. **Follow Naming Conventions**:
   - Test files: `test_<component_name>.py`
   - Test functions: `test_<functionality_being_tested>`
   - Test classes: `Test<ComponentName>`

2. **Isolate Dependencies**:
   - Use mocks or test doubles for dependencies
   - Inject dependencies rather than creating them inside components

3. **Use Fixtures for Common Setup**:
   - Create fixtures for reusable test components
   - Use fixture composition for complex setups

4. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**:
   - Focus on what the component does, not how it does it
   - Avoid over-mocking which can make tests brittle

5. **Follow the AAA Pattern**:
   - Arrange: Set up the test scenario
   - Act: Execute the functionality being tested
   - Assert: Verify the expected outcomes

6. **Include Edge Cases**:
   - Test empty/null inputs
   - Test boundary conditions
   - Test error handling

## Common Test Scenarios

### Testing Signal Connections

```python
def test_signal_connections(qtbot):
    # Create components
    model = ChestDataModel()
    controller = DataViewController(model)
    
    # Set up signal spy
    with qtbot.waitSignal(controller.data_validated, timeout=1000) as blocker:
        # Trigger the signal chain
        model.data_changed.emit()
    
    # Verify the signal was emitted with correct data
    assert blocker.args[0]['valid'] is True
```

### Testing UI Updates

```python
def test_ui_updates(qtbot):
    # Create view component
    view = DataViewAdapter()
    qtbot.addWidget(view)
    
    # Update data
    view.update_data(new_data)
    
    # Verify UI was updated
    assert view.table.rowCount() == len(new_data)
    assert view.table.item(0, 0).text() == str(new_data.iloc[0, 0])
```

### Testing Data Processing

```python
def test_data_processing():
    # Create service
    service = CSVService()
    
    # Process data
    result = service.process_data(test_data)
    
    # Verify results
    pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(result, expected_result)
```

## Performance Testing

Performance tests verify that the application performs efficiently:

```python
def test_large_dataset_performance():
    # Create large dataset
    large_data = create_large_dataset(100000)
    
    # Measure time for operation
    start_time = time.time()
    result = service.process_data(large_data)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Verify performance is acceptable
    assert duration < 1.0  # Operation should complete in under 1 second
```

## Test Mocks and Fakes

ChestBuddy uses several mock components for testing:

1. **MockDataManager**: Simulates the DataManager for testing controllers.
2. **MockUpdatableComponent**: Implements the IUpdatable interface for testing UpdateManager.
3. **MockValidationService**: Simulates validation for testing DataViewController.
4. **MockSignalReceiver**: Helps test signal emissions and connections.

## Debugging Tests

When tests fail:

1. **Use Verbose Output**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py
   ```

2. **Print Debug Information**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py --capture=no
   ```

3. **Debug Specific Test**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py::test_function_name --pdb
   ```

4. **Show Local Variables**:
   ```bash
   pytest -v path/to/failing/test.py --showlocals
   ```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. All tests run on each pull request.
2. Code coverage is reported.
3. Performance benchmarks are tracked over time.
4. Test failures block merging of pull requests.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Tests Fast**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent testing.
2. **Keep Tests Independent**: Tests should not depend on other tests or external state.
3. **Make Tests Readable**: Tests should clearly communicate what they're testing.
4. **Test One Thing at a Time**: Each test should focus on a single aspect of behavior.
5. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Names should describe what the test verifies.
6. **Keep Test Code Clean**: Apply the same code quality standards to tests as production code.
7. **Don't Test Framework Code**: Focus on testing your application code, not third-party libraries.
8. **Test Both Success and Failure Cases**: Verify how components handle errors and edge cases.

## Recent Test Improvements

1. **SignalTracer Integration Tests**: Added comprehensive tests for signal flow visualization.
2. **Data State Tracking Tests**: Enhanced tests for data dependency tracking and optimization.
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Added tests to measure performance with large datasets.
