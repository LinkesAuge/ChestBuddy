# Product Context

## Problem Space
Players of Total Battle currently use two separate applications to manage their chest data:

1. **Data Validation Challenge**: The ChestParser can import and analyze CSV data but lacks robust validation and correction capabilities, leading to issues with misidentified chests, player names (especially with German umlauts), and source locations.

2. **Workflow Fragmentation**: Users must currently use the CorrectionTool on OCR-extracted data before reformatting it for import into ChestParser, creating an inefficient and error-prone workflow.

3. **Data Quality Issues**: Without integrated validation, analysis results may be compromised by inconsistent naming, encoding issues, and other data quality problems.

## User Personas

### Individual Player
- **Goals**: Track personal chest collection, make optimal gameplay decisions, and contribute to alliance data.
- **Frustrations**: Data errors causing misattribution or miscalculation, complex workflow requiring multiple tools.
- **Needs**: Simple import process, automatic correction of common errors, personalized analysis.

### Clan Leader
- **Goals**: Track member contributions, analyze clan performance, provide data-backed feedback.
- **Frustrations**: Inconsistent data across members, time spent cleaning data before analysis.
- **Needs**: Batch validation and correction, clan-wide statistics, performance tracking over time.

### Data Maintainer
- **Goals**: Establish consistent naming conventions, ensure data quality, maintain correction rules.
- **Frustrations**: Constantly updating correction rules across multiple applications, dealing with encoding issues.
- **Needs**: Centralized rule management, easy rule updates, validation feedback.

## User Stories

1. As a clan leader, I want to import CSV chest data and have it automatically validated and corrected so I can quickly analyze player contributions.

2. As a player, I want to see which chest types and sources provide the best value so I can prioritize my gameplay activities.

3. As a data maintainer, I want to manage validation lists and correction rules in one place so I can ensure data consistency.

4. As a clan leader, I want to export both raw and corrected data so I can use it in other analysis tools.

5. As a player with a German username, I want automatic handling of umlaut characters so my contributions are accurately tracked.

## Solution Value

The Chest Buddy application will:

1. **Save Time**: Eliminate the multi-tool workflow by integrating validation, correction, and analysis in one application.

2. **Improve Accuracy**: Provide robust validation and correction features to ensure data quality.

3. **Enhance Insights**: Deliver powerful analysis and visualization capabilities to inform gameplay decisions.

4. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain centralized validation lists and correction rules for consistent data handling.

5. **Streamline Reporting**: Generate comprehensive, themed reports for sharing insights with clan members.
