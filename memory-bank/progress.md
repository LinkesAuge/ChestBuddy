# Project Progress

## What works

### Primary features
- Loading and saving the chest contents file
- Creating, editing, and deleting chest entries
- Categorizing items with labels
- Filtering by category and search term
- Automatic validation for data entry
- Exporting data to various formats
- Import from various formats

### Secondary features
- Context menu in data table with custom actions
- Drag and drop support for categories
- Auto-save functionality
- Batch edit operations
- Auto-field mapping during import
- Quick filters by date added
- Custom date formatting
- Sorting by multiple columns
- Status bar with summary information
- Export data with format options

### Correction feature
- Creation, editing, and deletion of correction rules
- Application of correction rules to data cells
- View with rule table
- Dialog to add new rules or edit existing rules
- Basic import/export of rules
- Cell highlighting based on correction status
- Color legend for highlighting
- Status bar showing rule counts
- Import/Export buttons in the header
- Simplified data structure (removed 'order' and 'description' fields)
- Fixed deletion functionality to prevent unwanted multiple deletions

## Recent Achievements

1. **Model Simplification**: Removed redundant 'order' and 'description' fields from CorrectionRule class, making the data structure more efficient and maintainable.

2. **Fixed Deletion Issues**: Resolved a bug where deleting a rule would incorrectly delete multiple entries by implementing proper index handling.

3. **UI Improvements**: Added status bar, import/export buttons, and color legend to make the correction interface more intuitive and functional.

4. **Controller Enhancements**: Updated methods to handle rules without explicit order values, relying on list position for ordering.

## Testing Status

- Total Tests: 565
- Passing: 448 (79%)
- Failing: 49 (9%)
- Errors: 62 (11%)
- Skipped: 6 (1%)

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Context Menu Enhancement**
   - Add rule application options
   - Add individual and batch correction options
   - Add validation details view option

2. **Import/Export Dialog**
   - Add file format options
   - Add preview capability
   - Implement duplicate handling
   - Add filtering options

3. **Batch Correction Dialog**
   - Improve pattern recognition
   - Add validation preview
   - Implement auto-suggestion feature
   - Optimize for multiple selections

4. **Settings Panel**
   - Add auto-correction preferences
   - Add validation options
   - Add display settings
   - Connect to ConfigManager

## Next Development Tasks

1. Implement context menu for CorrectionRuleView with actions for rules
2. Complete settings panel with configuration options
3. Enhance import/export dialog with preview capability
4. Improve batch correction dialog with pattern recognition
5. Implement context menu integration with DataView
6. Create integration tests for correction feature
7. Optimize performance for large datasets

## Current Focus

The current focus is on completing the UI implementation for the correction feature, specifically the enhanced context menu, improved import/export dialog, and batch correction capabilities.
