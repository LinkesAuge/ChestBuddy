- ✅ ValidationDelegate implemented and tested
- ✅ CorrectionDelegate implemented and tested
- ✅ ValidationAdapter base implemented
- ✅ CorrectionAdapter base implemented and tested
- ✅ Context menu actions implemented (add/edit/standard)
- ✅ Integration tests for DataViewModel/TableStateManager/Delegates (state propagation, paint, tooltips)
- ✅ ColumnModel implemented and integrated for visibility control
- ✅ FilterModel implemented and integrated for filtering
- ✅ Sorting via header clicks implemented (ViewModel and FilterModel)
- ✅ Column reordering support enabled in view
- ✅ Header context menu implemented for column visibility
- ✅ `DataViewModel` implementation complete (including sorting)
- ✅ `ValidationAdapter` implementation complete (handles validation results, transforms `status_df`, connects to service signal)
- ✅ Unit tests for `ValidationAdapter` updated and passing.
- ✅ Integration test for `ValidationService` -> `ValidationAdapter` -> `TableStateManager` workflow created and passing.
- ✅ `CorrectionAdapter` implementation complete (handles correction suggestions)
- ✅ Unit tests for `DataViewModel`, `CorrectionAdapter` passing
- ✅ Integration tests for Adapters -> StateManager -> ViewModel -> Delegates passing (basic)
- ✅ `CorrectionDelegate` signal emission refactor completed and tests updated.
- ✅ `CorrectionDelegate` unit tests passing (all 10 tests)
- ✅ **Unit Tests (Delegates):** All unit tests for `ValidationStatusDelegate`, `CorrectionDelegate`, `ReadOnlyDelegate`, and `TextEditDelegate` are passing, verifying their painting, editor creation, model data setting, and signal emission logic.
- ✅ **Unit Tests (Adapters):** Core unit tests for `ValidationAdapter` and `CorrectionAdapter` are passing, verifying transformation logic with mock services. `ValidationAdapter` tests updated for new `status_df` handling.
- ✅ **Integration Tests:** `ValidationService` -> `ValidationAdapter` -> `TableStateManager` integration successfully tested (`tests/integration/test_validation_integration.py`).
- ✅ **UI Implementation (Correction Delegate):** Implemented the basic UI interaction for single-click correction application via the `CorrectionDelegate`. The delegate now shows a menu and emits a `correction_selected` signal.
- ✅ **Adapter Integration (Correction - Phase 3):** Verified existing `CorrectionAdapter` code connects to the correct `CorrectionService` signal (`correction_suggestions_available`) and handles the expected payload.
- ✅ **Integration Tests (Correction Flow - Phase 8):** Fixed and verified the integration test (`test_correction_flow.py::test_correction_suggestion_updates_state`) for the `CorrectionService` -> `CorrectionAdapter` -> `TableStateManager` suggestion flow.
- ✅ **UI Correction Action Implementation (Phase 8):** Implemented the signal/slot connection from `CorrectionDelegate` -> `DataTableView` -> `DataViewController` to handle correction actions.
- ✅ **Integration Tests (Correction Application - Phase 8):** Added and passed integration test (`test_correction_flow.py::test_correction_action_triggers_service_call`) verifying the flow from simulated UI action trigger -> Controller -> `CorrectionService.apply_ui_correction` call.
- ✅ **Unit Tests (Context Menu):** Fixed mocking issue in `test_context_menu_factory.py` related to `QModelIndex.data`. All basic factory tests now pass.
- ✅ **Correction Rule Preview (Phase 4):**
    - Added "Preview Rule" action to `CorrectionRuleView` context menu.
    - Added `preview_rule_requested` signal to `CorrectionRuleView`.
    - Implemented `_on_preview_rule_requested` slot in `CorrectionController`.
    - Created `CorrectionPreviewDialog` to display preview data.
    - Connected controller slot to show dialog or message boxes based on service results.
    - Added unit tests for `CorrectionRuleView` preview action (existence, enabled state, signal emission).
    - Added unit tests for `CorrectionController` preview slot (dialog shown, no results msg, error msg, invalid input).
    - Added unit tests for `CorrectionPreviewDialog` (initialization, table population, OK button).
    - Fixed related import errors and test setup issues (`TypeError`, `AttributeError`).

### In Progress
- 🔄 **Phase 5: Architecture Refinement (Started)**
    - Reviewing and refining state flow and update logic.
    - Planning signal decoupling.
- 🔄 **Phase 8: Testing and Integration (Ongoing)**
    - Implementing remaining integration tests (full correction application cycle).
    - Planning UI tests.
- ⏳ **Phase 4: Context Menus and Advanced Features (Advanced - Partially Done)**
    - Implementing *actual logic* for cell-type specific actions (placeholders exist).
    - Implementing validation during cell editing.
    - Implementing correction preview.
    - Implementing batch correction UI.
    - Implementing Import/Export.
    - Implementing Search/Filter.
    - Implementing Data Visualization enhancements.

### Upcoming
- ⏳ **Phase 5: Architecture Refinement (Full Implementation)**
    - Ensure state updates strictly via `TableStateManager -> DataViewModel -> Delegate`.
    - Remove any direct UI manipulation for state visualization from view classes.
    - Optimize `DataViewModel` update methods (granular `dataChanged`).
    - Decouple Delegate Signals (use View signals, update `MainWindow` connections).
    - Verify `DataViewController` Integration with new components.
- ⏳ **Phase 6: Import/Export and Advanced Features**
- ⏳ **Phase 7: Performance Optimization**
- ⏳ **Phase 8: Testing and Integration (UI Tests)**
- ⏳ **Phase 9: Documentation and Cleanup**
    - Consolidate DataView Implementation (remove old `data_view.py` & `DataViewAdapter`).
- ⏳ Custom HeaderView implementation (if needed).

### Known Issues
- 🐞 **Dual Implementation Risk:** Coexistence of old (`ui/data_view.py`) and new (`ui/data/`) DataView structures increases complexity and risk until consolidation is complete. **(Highlighted by review)**
- 🐞 `RuntimeWarning: Failed to disconnect...` during `DataViewModel` cleanup (Deferred fix).
- 🐞 Mocking `ValidationService.get_validation_status` failing in integration tests (`test_correction_flow.py`).
- 🐞 `pytest` terminal output instability.

### Testing Status
- Unit test suite for core refactored components established.
- All CorrectionDelegate unit tests (10/10) are now passing.
- Integration test planning in progress, core interactions tested.
- **Correction Rule Preview Tests:** Unit tests added for View, Controller, and Dialog components. ✅ Completed.
- UI testing approach defined.

- **CorrectionDelegate Tests:** Fixed all test failures related to signal emission verification and size hints.
- **Context Menu Factory Test:** Fixed `TypeError` in `test_create_menu_invalid_cell` caused by incorrect keyword argument for `CellFullState`.
- **CorrectionRuleView Preview Tests:**
    - Fixed `TypeError: unhashable type: 'CorrectionRule'` by adding `__hash__`.
    - Fixed `AttributeError: 'CorrectionRuleView' object has no attribute '_get_selected_rule'` by using `_get_selected_rule_id` and controller.
    - Fixed `TimeoutError` in signal emission test by ensuring controller mock returned rule and adjusting test logic.

## What's Next
1.  **Test `CorrectionService.get_correction_preview` (Phase 8):** Add/verify unit tests for the service method used by the preview feature.
2.  **Implement Full Cycle Correction Test (Phase 8):** Complete the implementation of `test_correction_application_updates_state` to verify Model/State/View updates post-correction.
3.  **Analyze Post-Correction State Flow (Phase 5):** Trace/log the `TableStateManager -> DataViewModel -> Delegate` update path after corrections.
4.  **Implement Advanced Context Menu Features (Phase 4):** Start implementing logic for cell-type specific actions or validation during edit.
5.  **Plan Signal Decoupling Strategy (Phase 5):** Define approach for higher-level view signals.
6.  **Verify Controller Integration (Phase 5):** Test `DataViewController` interaction with refactored components.
7.  **Optimize Update Logic (Phase 5):** Refactor `DataViewModel` updates.
8.  *(Lower Priority)* Complete remaining Context Menu / Advanced UI tasks (Phase 4).
9.  *(Lower Priority)* Plan & Implement UI Tests (Phase 8).
10. *(Deferred)* Address `RuntimeWarning`.
11. *(Long Term)* Plan and execute removal of old DataView components (Phase 9).

## Known Issues
- **Dual Implementation Risk:** Coexistence of old and new DataView structures. **(Highlighted by review)**
- `RuntimeWarning` during `DataViewModel` cleanup (Deferred fix).
- Mocking issues in `test_correction_flow.py`.
- `pytest` terminal output instability.
- Old `main_window` tests likely failing.

## Implementation Progress
Phase 1 & 2 complete. Phase 3 (Adapter Integration) and 4 (Advanced Context Menu) are in progress. Phase 5 (Architecture Refinement) has started alongside Phase 3. Subsequent phases are planned.

## Overall Project Status
- DataView Refactoring: In Progress (Phases 3, 4, 5)

## Completed Work (DataView Refactoring)
- **Phase 2: Context Menu Implementation**
    - **Core Context Menu Structure:**
        - [x] Extensible action framework created (`base_action.py`, `ActionContext`).
        - [x] `ContextMenuFactory` implemented to dynamically create menus.
        - [x] Unit tests for factory structure added.
    - **Standard Actions:**
        - [x] `CopyAction`, `PasteAction`, `CutAction`, `DeleteAction` implemented.
        - [x] Unit tests for standard actions added.
    - **Advanced Context Menu Functionality:**
        - [x] `ViewErrorAction` implemented.
        - [x] `ApplyCorrectionAction` implemented (applies first suggestion).
        - [x] `AddToCorrectionListAction` created with dialog integration & service call (mocked).
        - [x] `AddCorrectionRuleDialog` created and tested.
        - [x] `AddToValidationListAction` created with dialog integration & service call (mocked).
        - [x] `AddValidationEntryDialog` created and tested.
        - [x] Unit tests for `ViewErrorAction`, `ApplyCorrectionAction`, `AddToCorrectionListAction`, `AddToValidationListAction` added/updated.
        - [x] Implement **Batch Correction/Validation Options**.
        - [x] **Cell Editing:** `EditCellAction`, `ShowEditDialogAction` implemented.
        - [x] Add unit tests for remaining actions (Batch actions, Cell Editing).
        - [x] Unit tests for basic `ContextMenuFactory` structure and actions passing.

## Remaining Work (DataView Refactoring)
- **Phase 3:** Connect Adapters to Services, Implement Correction Application Logic.
- **Phase 4:** Implement logic for cell-type specific actions, validation during editing, correction preview, batch correction UI, Import/Export, Search/Filter, Visualization Enhancements.
- **Phase 5:** Implement architecture refinements (State Flow, Update Logic, Signal Decoupling, Controller Verification).
- **Phase 6:** UI/Workflow Focus (Correction Preview, Batch Correction).
- **Phase 7:** Import/Export & Advanced Features.
- **Phase 8:** Testing and QA (Integration, UI).
- **Phase 9:** Documentation & Cleanup (Code Consolidation).

## Known Issues/Blocked Tasks
- `AddToCorrectionListAction` and `AddToValidationListAction` still use simulated service calls.
- Multi-cell selection for adding rules/list entries is not yet implemented.
- Actual visual rendering of validation/correction states via delegates is not implemented.
- Decision needed on how services are provided to `ActionContext` (see `activeContext.md`).

# Phase 3: UI-Service Integration & Testing (In Progress)

### Completed
- [x] `ValidationAdapter` connected to `ValidationService`.
- [x] `CorrectionAdapter` connected to `CorrectionService`.
- [x] Basic signal connections verified (`validation_changed`, `correction_suggestions_available`, etc.).
- [x] Integration tests for `ValidationFlow` implemented (`tests/integration/test_validation_flow.py`) - *Note: Currently passing, but may have hidden issues due to terminal output problems.*
- [x] Integration tests for `CorrectionFlow` implemented (`tests/integration/test_correction_flow.py`).

### In Progress / To Do
- [ ] **Correction Flow Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_correction_flow.py`)**: 
    - **Status:** Implemented but **SKIPPED**.
    - **Blockers:** 
        - Persistent `unittest.mock.patch` failures when trying to mock `ValidationService.get_validation_status`.
        - Suspected issues with `TableStateManager` not reacting correctly to `ChestDataModel.data_changed` signals, preventing state assertions from passing in application/batch tests.
        - Ongoing terminal output instability makes detailed debugging difficult.
    - **Next Steps:** Resolve mocking/environment issues before unskipping.
- [ ] **Further Integration Scenarios:** Add tests for edge cases, empty data, different correction rule types, etc. (Blocked by above).
- [ ] **UI Interaction Tests:** (Lower priority) Simulate user actions clicking apply/ignore corrections in the UI.

### Known Issues / Blockers
- **Integration Test Environment:** Mocking (`unittest.mock`) is behaving unexpectedly, and terminal output for `pytest` is often truncated or missing, severely hindering debugging of integration tests.
- **`TableStateManager` <-> `DataViewModel` Interaction:** The mechanism by which `TableStateManager` updates its state based on changes in the underlying `ChestDataModel` (likely via `DataViewModel`) needs investigation, as `state_changed` signals are not firing as expected in correction application tests.

- **Integration Tests:** Identified the location of DataView integration tests (`tests/integration/test_dataview_integration.py`). Existing tests cover basic state propagation and painting. Planning to add specific tests for correction tooltips, background color verification, context menu correction triggers, and indicator click triggers.

### What's Left to Build / Implement
- **DataView Refactoring:**
  - Complete Phase 3: Validation and Correction Integration
    - [ ] Implement UI for applying corrections (context menu actions, indicator click) - *Testing this interaction now*.
    - [ ] Implement one-click correction application from indicator/tooltip - *Testing this interaction now*.
    - [ ] Implement batch correction UI.
    - [x] Create specialized tests
      - [x] Validation visualization tests (partially covered by delegate/integration tests).
      - [/] Correction integration tests - *Adding more specific tests now*.
      - [ ] End-to-end validation/correction workflow tests (basic simulation exists, needs UI trigger).
- Implement UI testing
  - [ ] Test user workflows involving correction application via context menu/indicator.

### Completed Tasks

# ... existing code ...

- **Unit Tests (Delegates):** All unit tests for `ValidationStatusDelegate`, `CorrectionDelegate`, `ReadOnlyDelegate`, and `TextEditDelegate` are passing, verifying their painting, editor creation, model data setting, and signal emission logic.
- **Unit Tests (Adapters):** Core unit tests for `ValidationAdapter` and `CorrectionAdapter` are passing, verifying transformation logic with mock services.
- **UI Implementation (Correction Delegate):** Implemented the basic UI interaction for single-click correction application via the `CorrectionDelegate`. The delegate now shows a menu and emits a `correction_selected` signal.

### Ongoing Tasks

# ... existing code ...

- **Correction Workflow:**
    - Implement correction preview mechanism.
    - Implement batch correction UI and logic.
    - Connect `CorrectionDelegate`'s `correction_selected` signal to the `CorrectionAdapter` to trigger the `CorrectionService`.

# ... existing code ...

- **Integration Testing:**
    - Core interactions (loading, sorting, filtering) tested.
    - Basic correction signal flow via delegate interaction tested.
    - Develop comprehensive tests covering the full data lifecycle (load -> validate -> correct -> revalidate -> display).
    - Add tests for context menu actions and their interaction with services.
    - Test interaction between multiple delegates (e.g., editing causing validation changes).

# ... existing code ...

### Testing Status

    - `TextEditDelegate`: 100% coverage.
    - `ValidationAdapter`: Core transformation logic tested with mocks.
    - `CorrectionAdapter`: Core transformation logic tested with mocks.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Basic `DataView` setup and model interaction: Passing.
    - Sorting and filtering tests: Passing.
    - Context Menu basic actions: Passing.
    - Correction signal flow (delegate click -> signal emit): Tested and Passing.
    - End-to-end validation/correction flow: **Pending** (requires service connection).
- **Coverage:** Overall project coverage needs to be re-evaluated after integration tests are added.
