## What Works (Existing Functionality)
- Core data model and data handling
- CSV data import and export
- Data validation engine
- Basic data correction functionality
- Chart generation and visualization
- Configuration management system
- Basic navigation between views
- MainWindow core functionality

## Recently Fixed
- Validation visualization system now correctly displays validation statuses
- Proper integration between validation service and data view
- Enhanced validation status delegate to prioritize and color-code statuses

## What's Next
1. Begin implementation of the `ValidationDelegate`.
2. Add tests for `ValidationDelegate` painting logic.
3. Implement `CorrectionDelegate`.
4. Implement `ValidationAdapter` and `CorrectionAdapter`.
5. Add advanced context menu features.

## Known Issues
- Current DataView limitations (as documented before refactoring)
- *No new issues identified during current implementation.*
