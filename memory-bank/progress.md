# ChestBuddy Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1-10: Core Functionality âœ…
All core functionality including data model, services, UI components, and end-to-end workflows are implemented and tested.

### Phase 11: Validation Service Improvements âœ…
- Fixed date parsing warnings in the ValidationService
- Added specific date format to `pd.to_datetime` calls to prevent warnings
- Created tests to verify the fixes
- Ensured all validation tests pass without warnings

### Phase 12: Chart Integration âœ…
- Implemented ChartService for generating various chart types (bar, pie, line)
- Fixed compatibility issues with PySide6 6.8.2.1
- Created comprehensive tests for all chart functionality
- Fixed method calls in ChartTab to match ChartService API
- Created comprehensive integration and performance tests
- All chart-related tests are now passing successfully

### Phase 13: CSV Loading Improvements âœ…
- Implemented MultiCSVLoadTask for handling multiple files with progress reporting
- Added progress dialog to show loading status to users
- Implemented chunked reading for better memory efficiency with large files
- Added cancellation support for long-running operations
- Created comprehensive test suite for the new functionality
- Enhanced error handling during file loading operations

## Project Completion Status

- Project Setup: 100%
- Core Components: 100%
- Testing: 95%
- UI Implementation: 90%
- Documentation: 80%
- Overall Completion: 95%

## Current Status

We have implemented CSV Loading Improvements as part of Phase 13, which enhances the user experience when working with CSV files in the application. The improvements include progress reporting, cancellation support, and more efficient handling of large files.

1. MultiCSVLoadTask for loading multiple files with progress tracking
2. Progress dialog in the main UI showing loading status and file information
3. Cancellation button allowing users to abort long-running operations
4. Chunked file reading for better memory efficiency with large files
5. Comprehensive tests for all CSV loading functionality

The application now allows users to:
- Load and validate CSV data files with visual progress indication
- Cancel file loading operations if needed
- Work with larger files without memory issues
- Load multiple files at once with consolidated feedback
- Visualize the data using various chart types
- Export charts as image files
