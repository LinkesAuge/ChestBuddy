## Notes

### Implemented Features Details

#### Core Utilities
- **ConfigManager**: Singleton pattern implementation that manages application configuration, handles settings persistence, and provides type-safe access to configuration values.

#### Data Models
- **BaseModel**: Abstract base class with common model functionality and signal support.
- **ChestDataModel**: Core data model that manages the chest data using pandas DataFrame, emits signals for changes, and tracks validation and correction status.

#### Services
- **CSVService**: Handles reading and writing CSV files with encoding detection and normalization.
- **ValidationService**: Validates data against rules, tracks validation status, and provides methods to export validation reports.
- **CorrectionService**: Applies various correction strategies to data, maintains correction history, and provides methods to export correction reports.

#### UI Components
- **MainWindow**: Main application window with menu bar, toolbar, and tab widget.
- **DataView**: Displays and allows editing of data in a table view.
- **ValidationTab**: Displays validation issues and allows running validation with selected rules.
- **CorrectionTab**: Provides interface for applying corrections with various strategies.

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core components, models, and services.
- **UI Tests**: Tests for UI components that verify proper initialization and behavior.
- **Test Data**: Sample valid and invalid data for testing validation and correction.
- **Test Runner**: Script to run tests with coverage reporting.

### Current Blockers
None currently.

### Next Steps
1. Improve error handling
2. Optimize performance for large datasets
3. Implement chart integration
4. Begin report generation features

## Notes

The test suite has been completely fixed. All 50 tests are now passing. We had to make several adjustments to the test code to align with the current implementation:

1. Fixed method name mismatches (e.g., `_validate_button` vs `_validate_btn`, `get_all_validation_status` vs `get_validation_status`)
2. Updated tests to work with the current API (e.g., `filter_data` expecting a dictionary rather than individual parameters)
3. Improved the approach to testing UI components by properly mocking methods to avoid actual filtering and UI updates

CSV file encoding is another issue we need to address, especially for files containing German umlauts and other special characters.

With the test suite now fully functional, we can focus on implementing the remaining features and addressing the performance considerations for larger datasets. 

## In Progress

- Implementing enhanced CSV encoding detection and handling
  - Created test cases demonstrating encoding issues with various character sets
  - Identified specific issues with Shift JIS encoded files (Japanese characters)
  - Planning implementation of improved encoding detection and fallback mechanisms
- Implementing comprehensive error handling
- Addressing performance issues with large datasets

## Next Steps

- Complete enhancement of CSVService for better encoding handling:
  - Add configurable encoding parameter to read_csv method
  - Implement more robust encoding detection using chardet/charset-normalizer
  - Add better fallback chain for encoding detection
  - Support BOM detection in CSV files
  - Create more comprehensive text normalization for international characters
- Add additional test coverage for edge cases and error conditions
- Refactor tests to follow best practices and improve organization
- Implement performance tests for large datasets
- Improve CSV encoding handling for international character sets
- Begin implementation of chart integration (Phase 8)
- Enhance user interface for better usability
