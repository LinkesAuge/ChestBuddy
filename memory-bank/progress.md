# Project Progress

## Overall Status

ChestBuddy is currently focused on a comprehensive refactoring of the DataView component, which is a central element of the application. This refactoring aims to address limitations in validation status display, context menu functionality, data interaction, and performance with large datasets.

## What Works (Existing Functionality)
- Core data model and data handling
- CSV data import and export
- Data validation engine
- Basic data correction functionality
- Chart generation and visualization
- Configuration management system
- Basic navigation between views
- MainWindow core functionality

## Recently Fixed
- Validation visualization system now correctly displays validation statuses
- Proper integration between validation service and data view
- Enhanced validation status delegate to prioritize and color-code statuses

## What's Next
1. Implement the folder structure for the DataView refactoring
2. Create the base model classes (DataViewModel, FilterModel)
3. Create the base view classes (DataTableView, HeaderView)
4. Implement initial unit tests for these components
5. Begin implementing core functionality (data loading, column handling)

## Known Issues
- Current DataView has inconsistent display of validation statuses
- Limited context menu functionality
- Inefficient handling of multi-selection operations
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Code duplication and lack of clear boundaries in current implementation

## Testing Status

| Component Type | Total Tests | Passing | Coverage | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Current UI Components | 78 | 63 | Varies | View tests need updates |
| DataView New Components | 0 | 0 | 0% | Tests not yet implemented |

### DataView Component Test Plan

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | UI Tests | Performance Tests |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| DataViewModel | Planned | Planned | N/A | Planned |
| FilterModel | Planned | Planned | N/A | Planned |
| DataTableView | Planned | Planned | Planned | Planned |
| CellDelegate | Planned | Planned | Planned | N/A |
| ValidationDelegate | Planned | Planned | Planned | N/A |
| CorrectionDelegate | Planned | Planned | Planned | N/A |
| ContextMenu | Planned | Planned | Planned | N/A |

## Implementation Progress

The DataView refactoring is currently in the planning and design phase. All design documentation has been completed, and we are about to begin implementation of the core components.
