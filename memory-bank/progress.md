2. ✅ Fixed missing automatic updates by implementing proper signal connections in the DataViewAdapter
3. ✅ Fixed initialization order issue in the DataViewAdapter that was causing application startup errors

These fixes have significantly improved the stability and performance of the data display in the application, eliminating redundant updates and ensuring proper data flow through the component hierarchy.

### Architecture Improvements
