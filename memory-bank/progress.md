- Created complete controller set (FileOperations, Progress, ErrorHandling, ViewState, DataView, UIState)
- Standardized progress reporting and error handling through controllers
- Reduced UI code duplication and improved maintainability
- Removed UI-specific logic from DataManager
- Refactored MainWindow to delegate responsibilities to appropriate controllers

### Phase 16: UI Component Adaptation ✅
- Adapt UI components to use controllers (Complete)
- Refactored DataViewAdapter to use DataViewController
- Refactored ValidationViewAdapter to use DataViewController
- Refactored CorrectionViewAdapter to use DataViewController
- Refactored ChartViewAdapter to use DataViewController
- Created comprehensive tests for controller interactions
- Updated main application to integrate all controllers
