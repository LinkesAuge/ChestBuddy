# Progress

## Current Status - May 10, 2024

The ChestBuddy application has made significant progress with the correction feature implementation. We've successfully implemented many components, but after comparing with our mockup, we've identified several UI gaps that need to be addressed.

### Recently Completed

#### UI Component Implementation
- ✅ Successfully implemented the `CorrectionRuleView` component to pass all 16 tests
- ✅ Successfully implemented the `AddEditRuleDialog` component to pass all 12 tests
- ✅ Verified that the `ImportExportDialog` component passes all 16 tests
- ✅ Implemented BatchCorrectionDialog component, passing all 12 tests
- ✅ Integrated correction feature with DataView via context menu and highlighting

#### Key Implementation Fixes
- ✅ Ensured attribute names in UI components match test expectations
- ✅ Properly implemented button state management based on selection state
- ✅ Correctly connected signals between UI elements
- ✅ Properly populated table data with appropriate user data for rule identification
- ✅ Fixed rule filtering, status bar updates, and delete confirmation functionality

### CorrectionView UI Gaps Identified

After comparing the current implementation with our mockup design in `correction_feature_ui_mockup.html`, we've identified several gaps:

#### Missing UI Elements
- ❌ Import/Export buttons in the header
- ❌ Dedicated status bar for CorrectionView (currently using MainWindow's status bar)
- ❌ Complete rule control buttons (Move Up/Down, Toggle Status)
- ❌ Settings panel with configuration options
- ❌ Context menu for rule actions

#### Styling Improvements Needed
- ❌ Status bar size needs to be reduced to match mockup
- ❌ Table styling needs refinement for consistency
- ❌ Button placement needs adjustment to match mockup layout

### CorrectionView Implementation Plan

To address these gaps, we've developed a plan with the following phases:

#### Phase 1: Status Bar & Missing Header Actions
- Add dedicated QStatusBar component to CorrectionView
- Add Import/Export buttons to header with file dialog integration
- Connect buttons to existing controller methods

#### Phase 2: Settings Panel & Rule Controls
- Add settings panel with configuration checkboxes
- Complete rule management buttons (Move, Toggle)
- Connect settings to ConfigManager for persistence

#### Phase 3: UI Styling & Context Menu
- Ensure consistent styling with mockup
- Add context menu for row operations
- Enhance filter controls functionality

#### Phase 4: Testing & Integration
- Create unit tests for new UI components
- Integrate with validation workflow
- Verify all functionality matches mockup requirements
