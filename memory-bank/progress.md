## Notes

### Implemented Features Details

#### Core Utilities
- **ConfigManager**: Singleton pattern implementation that manages application configuration, handles settings persistence, and provides type-safe access to configuration values.

#### Data Models
- **BaseModel**: Abstract base class with common model functionality and signal support.
- **ChestDataModel**: Core data model that manages the chest data using pandas DataFrame, emits signals for changes, and tracks validation and correction status.

#### Services
- **CSVService**: Handles reading and writing CSV files with encoding detection and normalization.
- **ValidationService**: Validates data against rules, tracks validation status, and provides methods to export validation reports.
- **CorrectionService**: Applies various correction strategies to data, maintains correction history, and provides methods to export correction reports.

#### UI Components
- **MainWindow**: Main application window with menu bar, toolbar, and tab widget.
- **DataView**: Displays and allows editing of data in a table view.
- **ValidationTab**: Displays validation issues and allows running validation with selected rules.
- **CorrectionTab**: Provides interface for applying corrections with various strategies.

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core components, models, and services.
- **UI Tests**: Tests for UI components that verify proper initialization and behavior.
- **Test Data**: Sample valid and invalid data for testing validation and correction.
- **Test Runner**: Script to run tests with coverage reporting.

### Current Blockers
None currently.

### Next Steps
