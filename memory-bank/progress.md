# Project Progress

## Project Status: Initial Setup and Design

The Chest Buddy project is in the initial setup and design phase. We are establishing the foundation for development by creating the basic project structure, defining the architecture, documenting requirements, and creating UI designs.

## What Works

- Project repository has been created
- Basic files are initialized:
  - README.md
  - main.py
  - pyproject.toml
  - .python-version
- Virtual environment set up with Python 3.12
- Memory Bank established for project documentation
- Project requirements defined
- Comprehensive UI design mockups created
- Interactive HTML UI example created (docs/UI-example.html)

## What's In Progress

- Defining project architecture and design patterns
- Setting up core project structure
- Planning component relationships
- Documenting technical approach
- Implementing the basic UI layout based on mockups

## UI Design Status

- Created comprehensive mockups for all main application sections:
  - Dashboard view
  - Data Management (Import, Validate, Correct, Export)
  - Analysis (Data Table, Charts)
  - Reports
  - Settings (Validation Lists, Correction Rules)
- Defined application color scheme and typography
- Designed navigation structure with clear workflow
- Established responsive design patterns
- Documented mockups in docs/UI design.md
- Created interactive HTML example in docs/UI-example.html that demonstrates:
  - Working navigation sidebar with active states
  - Dashboard layout with statistics cards
  - Chart placeholders and quick action buttons
  - Responsive grid layouts
  - Dark theme with defined color palette using CSS variables
  - Roboto typography
