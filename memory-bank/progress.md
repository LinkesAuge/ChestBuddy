# ChestBuddy Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1-10: Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- Implemented core data model with pandas DataFrames
- Created services for CSV operations, validation, and correction
- Built basic UI with tabs for different functionality
- Implemented end-to-end workflows for data processing
- Added background processing for long-running operations
- Created configuration management system

### Phase 11: Validation Service Improvements ‚úÖ
- Fixed date parsing warnings in the ValidationService
- Added specific date format to `pd.to_datetime` calls
- Improved validation with configurable strictness levels
- Enhanced validation visualization in the UI

### Phase 12: Chart Integration ‚úÖ
- Implemented ChartService for various chart types (bar, pie, line)
- Fixed compatibility issues with PySide6 6.8.2.1
- Added chart customization options
- Integrated charts into the UI with proper data binding

### Phase 13: CSV Loading and Progress Reporting ‚úÖ
- Implemented MultiCSVLoadTask for handling multiple files
- Added chunked reading for better memory efficiency
- Created comprehensive progress reporting system
- Enhanced error handling during file loading
- Implemented cancellation support for long operations

### Phase 14: UI Enhancement ‚úÖ
- Created reusable UI components (ActionButton, ActionToolbar, etc.)
- Enhanced sidebar navigation with data-dependent state handling
- Improved dashboard with empty state support
- Implemented progress dialog with visual feedback states
- Added consistent styling across all components

### Phase 15: UI Refactoring üîÑ
- Extract controllers from MainWindow to improve code organization
- Implement proper separation between UI and business logic
- Standardize progress reporting and error handling
- Reduce UI code duplication and improve maintainability
- Remove UI-specific logic from DataManager
