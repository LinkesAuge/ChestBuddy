## Known Issues

### UI Blocking After First Import
- 🔴 **Issue**: UI remains blocked after confirming the progress dialog on the first import
- **Details**: Despite multiple fix attempts with timing-based solutions, UI elements remain blocked
- **Cause**: Lack of centralized UI state management and reference counting for nested operations
- **Solution**: Implementing a comprehensive UI State Management system (in progress)
- **Status**: In active development - UI State Management core components complete, integration in progress

### Performance with Large Datasets
- 🟠 **Issue**: Performance degradation with very large data sets (>1M rows)
- **Details**: UI becomes sluggish, memory usage increases significantly
- **Cause**: In-memory data processing and lack of data virtualization
- **Solution**: Implementing chunked processing and virtual scrolling
- **Status**: Being addressed with performance optimization work

### Chart Export Quality
- 🟡 **Issue**: Exported charts have lower resolution than displayed charts
- **Details**: PNG exports appear pixelated in some cases
- **Cause**: Using screen resolution for export rather than print resolution
- **Solution**: Implement high-DPI chart rendering for exports
- **Status**: Minor issue to be addressed in future updates
