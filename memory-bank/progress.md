### Phase 14: UI Enhancement ✅
- Created reusable UI components (ActionButton, ActionToolbar, etc.)
- Enhanced sidebar navigation with data-dependent state handling
- Improved dashboard with empty state support
- Implemented progress dialog with visual feedback states
- Added consistent styling across all components

### Phase 15: UI Refactoring ✅
- Implemented proper controller architecture for separation between UI and business logic
- Created complete controller set (FileOperations, Progress, ErrorHandling, ViewState, DataView, UIState)
- Standardized progress reporting and error handling through controllers
- Reduced UI code duplication and improved maintainability
- Removed UI-specific logic from DataManager
- Refactored MainWindow to delegate responsibilities to appropriate controllers

### Phase 16: UI Component Adaptation ✅
- Adapted UI components to use controllers
- Refactored DataViewAdapter to use DataViewController
- Refactored ValidationViewAdapter to use DataViewController
- Refactored CorrectionViewAdapter to use DataViewController
