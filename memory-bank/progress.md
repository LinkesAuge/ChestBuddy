## In Progress

### Phase 6: Error Handling and Optimization
- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Bug fixes from testing

### Phase 7 - Test Suite Maintenance and Fixes

#### Completed:
- Fixed `QApplication` handling in tests to properly manage the singleton instance
- Created `test_default_files.py` which successfully tests loading default files
- Fixed method name mismatches in ChestDataModel (get_all_validation_status vs get_validation_status)
- Fixed update_value method call to use update_data instead
- Fixed `test_services.py` - all tests now pass

#### In Progress:
- Updating `test_ui_components.py` to match the current UI implementation
- Fixing `test_app.py` to properly handle `QApplication` instance
- Implementing proper mocks for tests to avoid direct instantiation of UI components

#### Next Steps:
- Complete the remaining test fixes
- Add additional test coverage for key functionality
- Refactor tests to follow best practices

### Phase 8: Chart Integration
- [ ] Design chart interface
- [ ] Implement basic chart functionality
- [ ] Create chart tab
- [ ] Add export functionality for charts

### Phase 9: Report Generation
- [ ] Design report templates
- [ ] Implement report generator service
- [ ] Create report preview
- [ ] Implement export functionality

### Phase 10: Additional Features
- [ ] Add user preferences dialog
- [ ] Implement automatic updates
- [ ] Add help documentation
- [ ] Create installer

## Notes

### Implemented Features Details

#### Core Utilities
- **ConfigManager**: Singleton pattern implementation that manages application configuration, handles settings persistence, and provides type-safe access to configuration values.

#### Data Models
- **BaseModel**: Abstract base class with common model functionality and signal support.
- **ChestDataModel**: Core data model that manages the chest data using pandas DataFrame, emits signals for changes, and tracks validation and correction status.

#### Services
- **CSVService**: Handles reading and writing CSV files with encoding detection and normalization.
- **ValidationService**: Validates data against rules, tracks validation status, and provides methods to export validation reports.
- **CorrectionService**: Applies various correction strategies to data, maintains correction history, and provides methods to export correction reports.

#### UI Components
- **MainWindow**: Main application window with menu bar, toolbar, and tab widget.
- **DataView**: Displays and allows editing of data in a table view.
- **ValidationTab**: Displays validation issues and allows running validation with selected rules.
- **CorrectionTab**: Provides interface for applying corrections with various strategies.

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core components, models, and services.
- **UI Tests**: Tests for UI components that verify proper initialization and behavior.
- **Test Data**: Sample valid and invalid data for testing validation and correction.
- **Test Runner**: Script to run tests with coverage reporting.

### Current Blockers
None currently.

### Next Steps
1. Improve error handling
2. Optimize performance for large datasets
3. Implement chart integration
4. Begin report generation features

## Notes

The test suite is currently our main focus. Many tests are failing due to API mismatches between the tests and the actual implementation. We are systematically fixing these issues to ensure all tests pass correctly.

The QApplication handling in tests has been improved but some tests still have issues. We need to ensure that all tests properly create and clean up QApplication instances to avoid conflicts between tests.

CSV file encoding is another issue we need to address, especially for files containing German umlauts and other special characters.

Once the test suite is fixed, we can continue with implementing the remaining features.
