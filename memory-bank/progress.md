- Fixed compatibility issues with PySide6 6.8.2.1
- Added chart customization options
- Integrated charts into the UI with proper data binding

### Phase 13: CSV Loading and Progress Reporting ‚úÖ
- Implemented MultiCSVLoadTask for handling multiple files
- Added chunked reading for better memory efficiency
- Created comprehensive progress reporting system
- Enhanced error handling during file loading
- Implemented cancellation support for long operations

### Phase 14: UI Enhancement ‚úÖ
- Created reusable UI components (ActionButton, ActionToolbar, etc.)
- Enhanced sidebar navigation with data-dependent state handling
- Improved dashboard with empty state support
- Implemented progress dialog with visual feedback states
- Added consistent styling across all components

### Phase 15: UI Refactoring üîÑ
- Implement proper controller architecture for separation between UI and business logic
- Standardize progress reporting and error handling
- Reduce UI code duplication and improve maintainability
- Remove UI-specific logic from DataManager
- Refactor MainWindow to delegate responsibilities to appropriate controllers

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- **Data Model**: Stable pandas-based data model with proper signal notifications
- **CSV Import**: Multi-file import with progress reporting and error handling
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation against reference lists
- **Correction Rules**: Application of correction rules with various matching options
- **Charts**: Multiple chart types with customization options
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper categorization and logging

### User Interface
- **Navigation**: Sidebar navigation with data-dependent state handling
- **Dashboard**: Overview dashboard with empty state support
- **Data View**: Data table with filtering and sorting
- **Validation View**: Visual indicators for validation issues
- **Correction View**: Manual and automatic correction application
- **Chart View**: Interactive charts with filtering options
- **Error Reporting**: Consistent error display with detailed information
- **View State Management**: Robust view state management with transition animations, history tracking, and state persistence

### Background Processing
- **Worker System**: Robust background worker implementation
- **Progress Reporting**: Detailed progress reporting with visual feedback
- **Cancellation**: Support for cancelling long-running operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful recovery from errors during file operations

### User Experience
- **Responsive UI**: Application remains responsive during processing
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for all operations
- **Consistent Design**: Unified style and interaction patterns
- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages with actionable information
- **Progress Indication**: Detailed progress updates during long operations
- **View Transitions**: Smooth transitions between views with proper state persistence

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Refactor UI Components**
   - Update all views to use controllers
   - Remove direct event handling from UI components
   - Improve separation of concerns

2. **Implement Comprehensive Tests**
   - Complete integration tests for all controllers
   - Test controller interactions
   - Verify proper error handling

3. **Update Project Documentation**
   - Reflect the new controller-based architecture
   - Document new interfaces and patterns

## Technical Challenges

- **Memory Optimization**: Very large datasets (50,000+ rows) can still cause memory pressure
- **Thread Cleanup**: Minor thread cleanup warnings during application shutdown
- **UI Responsiveness**: Occasional UI freezes during extremely intensive operations
- **Report Generation**: Design and implementation of the PDF export functionality
- **Settings Persistence**: More robust storage of application settings
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: More sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
