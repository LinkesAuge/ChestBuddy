## Notes

### Implemented Features Details

#### Core Utilities
- **ConfigManager**: Singleton pattern implementation that manages application configuration, handles settings persistence, and provides type-safe access to configuration values.

#### Data Models
- **BaseModel**: Abstract base class with common model functionality and signal support.
- **ChestDataModel**: Core data model that manages the chest data using pandas DataFrame, emits signals for changes, and tracks validation and correction status.

#### Services
- **CSVService**: Handles reading and writing CSV files with advanced encoding detection and normalization, supporting international character sets including Japanese and European languages. Now supports chunked reading for large files with progress reporting and background processing.
- **ValidationService**: Validates data against rules, tracks validation status, and provides methods to export validation reports.
- **CorrectionService**: Applies various correction strategies to data, maintains correction history, and provides methods to export correction reports.

#### UI Components
- **MainWindow**: Main application window with menu bar, toolbar, and tab widget.
- **DataView**: Displays and allows editing of data in a table view.
- **ValidationTab**: Displays validation issues and allows running validation with selected rules.
- **CorrectionTab**: Provides interface for applying corrections with various strategies.

#### Background Processing
- **BackgroundWorker**: Worker class for executing tasks in background threads.
- **BackgroundTask**: Base class for implementing background tasks with progress reporting.
- **CSVReadTask**: Background task implementation for reading CSV files in chunks.

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core components, models, and services.
- **UI Tests**: Basic tests for UI components that verify initialization and functionality.
