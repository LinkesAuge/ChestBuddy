- ⏳ Custom HeaderView implementation (if more features needed beyond sorting/reorder/visibility)

### Known Issues
- 🐞 No major issues identified in refactored code yet.
- 🐞 `RuntimeWarning: Failed to disconnect...` during `DataViewModel` cleanup (Deferred fix).

### Testing Status
- Unit test suite for core refactored components established.
- All CorrectionDelegate unit tests (10/10) are now passing.
- Integration test planning in progress.
- UI testing approach defined.

## What Works (Existing Functionality)
- Core data model and data handling
- CSV data import and export
- Data validation engine
- Basic data correction functionality
- Chart generation and visualization
- Configuration management system
- Basic navigation between views
- MainWindow core functionality
- Core DataView Refactor (Phase 1): Display, Sorting, Filtering, Visibility
- Core Delegates (Validation, Correction) rendering and basic interaction (menu trigger)
- Core Adapters (Validation, Correction) transforming mock data and updating StateManager
- Core StateManager updating ViewModel
- Core Context Menu actions (edit, add/correct lists)
- Core Filter/Sort models

## Recently Fixed
- Test collection errors related to imports
- Test failures in delegate tests due to super() calls
- Test failures in adapter tests due to placeholder logic/assertions
- Fixed mock setup for `get_full_cell_state` in `DataViewModel` tests
- **RuntimeError Crash:** Resolved `RuntimeError: Internal C++ object (...) already deleted` during test teardown in `SignalManager`.
- **CorrectionDelegate Tests:** Fixed all test failures related to signal emission verification and size hints.
- **Context Menu Factory Test:** Fixed `TypeError` in `test_create_menu_invalid_cell` caused by incorrect keyword argument for `CellFullState`.

## What's Next
1.  Complete remaining Phase 4 (Context Menu) tasks: Selection-aware menu actions, validation during edit.
2.  Connect Adapters (`ValidationAdapter`, `CorrectionAdapter`) to the actual `ValidationService` and `CorrectionService`.
3.  Implement UI for applying corrections (e.g., via delegate interaction or context menu).
4.  Refine Adapter transformation logic & State Manager updates based on real service data.
5.  Develop key integration tests for full workflows (e.g., validate -> correct -> revalidate) and edge cases.
6.  *(Deferred)* Investigate and fix `RuntimeWarning: Failed to disconnect...` in `DataViewModel` cleanup.

## Known Issues
- Current DataView limitations (as documented before refactoring)
- Large number of failing/erroring tests in older test suites (e.g., `main_window` tests) due to refactoring and missing dependencies.
- **RuntimeWarning during Cleanup:** Tests show `RuntimeWarning: Failed to disconnect...` originating from `DataViewModel`'s cleanup attempts after related objects (`_source_model`, `_state_manager`) might have been destroyed. This does not cause test failures but indicates suboptimal cleanup logic. (Deferred fix)

    - Add docstrings and update external documentation.
    - Final code reviews and cleanup.

## Known Issues/Blocked Tasks

- `AddToCorrectionListAction` and `AddToValidationListAction` still use simulated service calls.
- Multi-cell selection for adding rules/list entries is not yet implemented.
- Actual visual rendering of validation/correction states via delegates is not implemented.
- Decision needed on how services are provided to `ActionContext` (see `activeContext.md`).

# Phase 3: UI-Service Integration & Testing (In Progress)

### Completed
- [x] `ValidationAdapter` connected to `ValidationService`.
- [x] `CorrectionAdapter` connected to `CorrectionService`.
- [x] Basic signal connections verified (`validation_changed`, `correction_suggestions_available`, etc.).
- [x] Integration tests for `ValidationFlow` implemented (`tests/integration/test_validation_flow.py`) - *Note: Currently passing, but may have hidden issues due to terminal output problems.*
- [x] Integration tests for `CorrectionFlow` implemented (`tests/integration/test_correction_flow.py`).

### In Progress / To Do
- [ ] **Correction Flow Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_correction_flow.py`)**: 
    - **Status:** Implemented but **SKIPPED**.
    - **Blockers:** 
        - Persistent `unittest.mock.patch` failures when trying to mock `ValidationService.get_validation_status`.
        - Suspected issues with `TableStateManager` not reacting correctly to `ChestDataModel.data_changed` signals, preventing state assertions from passing in application/batch tests.
        - Ongoing terminal output instability makes detailed debugging difficult.
    - **Next Steps:** Resolve mocking/environment issues before unskipping.
- [ ] **Further Integration Scenarios:** Add tests for edge cases, empty data, different correction rule types, etc. (Blocked by above).
- [ ] **UI Interaction Tests:** (Lower priority) Simulate user actions clicking apply/ignore corrections in the UI.

### Known Issues / Blockers
- **Integration Test Environment:** Mocking (`unittest.mock`) is behaving unexpectedly, and terminal output for `pytest` is often truncated or missing, severely hindering debugging of integration tests.
- **`TableStateManager` <-> `DataViewModel` Interaction:** The mechanism by which `TableStateManager` updates its state based on changes in the underlying `ChestDataModel` (likely via `DataViewModel`) needs investigation, as `state_changed` signals are not firing as expected in correction application tests.

- **Integration Tests:** Identified the location of DataView integration tests (`tests/integration/test_dataview_integration.py`). Existing tests cover basic state propagation and painting. Planning to add specific tests for correction tooltips, background color verification, context menu correction triggers, and indicator click triggers.

### What's Left to Build / Implement
- **DataView Refactoring:**
  - Complete Phase 3: Validation and Correction Integration
    - [ ] Implement UI for applying corrections (context menu actions, indicator click) - *Testing this interaction now*.
    - [ ] Implement one-click correction application from indicator/tooltip - *Testing this interaction now*.
    - [ ] Implement batch correction UI.
    - [x] Create specialized tests
      - [x] Validation visualization tests (partially covered by delegate/integration tests).
      - [/] Correction integration tests - *Adding more specific tests now*.
      - [ ] End-to-end validation/correction workflow tests (basic simulation exists, needs UI trigger).
- Implement UI testing
  - [ ] Test user workflows involving correction application via context menu/indicator.

### Completed Tasks

# ... existing code ...

- **Unit Tests (Delegates):** All unit tests for `ValidationStatusDelegate`, `CorrectionDelegate`, `ReadOnlyDelegate`, and `TextEditDelegate` are passing, verifying their painting, editor creation, model data setting, and signal emission logic.
- **Unit Tests (Adapters):** Core unit tests for `ValidationAdapter` and `CorrectionAdapter` are passing, verifying transformation logic with mock services.
- **UI Implementation (Correction Delegate):** Implemented the basic UI interaction for single-click correction application via the `CorrectionDelegate`. The delegate now shows a menu and emits a `correction_selected` signal.

### Ongoing Tasks

# ... existing code ...

- **Correction Workflow:**
    - Implement correction preview mechanism.
    - Implement batch correction UI and logic.
    - Connect `CorrectionDelegate`'s `correction_selected` signal to the `CorrectionAdapter` to trigger the `CorrectionService`.

# ... existing code ...

- **Integration Testing:**
    - Core interactions (loading, sorting, filtering) tested.
    - Basic correction signal flow via delegate interaction tested.
    - Develop comprehensive tests covering the full data lifecycle (load -> validate -> correct -> revalidate -> display).
    - Add tests for context menu actions and their interaction with services.
    - Test interaction between multiple delegates (e.g., editing causing validation changes).

### Testing Status

- **Unit Tests:**
    - `DataViewModel`: 100% coverage (excluding cleanup warning).
    - `TableStateManager`: 100% coverage.
    - `ValidationStatusDelegate`: 100% coverage.
    - `CorrectionDelegate`: 100% coverage. All tests passing.
    - `ReadOnlyDelegate`: 100% coverage.
    - `TextEditDelegate`: 100% coverage.
    - `ValidationAdapter`: Core transformation logic tested with mocks.
    - `CorrectionAdapter`: Core transformation logic tested with mocks.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Basic `DataView` setup and model interaction: Passing.
    - Sorting and filtering tests: Passing.
    - Context Menu basic actions: Passing.
    - Correction signal flow (delegate click -> signal emit): Tested and Passing.
    - End-to-end validation/correction flow: **Pending** (requires service connection).
- **Coverage:** Overall project coverage needs to be re-evaluated after integration tests are added.
