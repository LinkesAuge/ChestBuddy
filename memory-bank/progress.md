## What Works (Existing Functionality)
- Core data model and data handling
- CSV data import and export
- Data validation engine
- Basic data correction functionality
- Chart generation and visualization
- Configuration management system
- Basic navigation between views
- MainWindow core functionality

## Recently Fixed
- Validation visualization system now correctly displays validation statuses
- Proper integration between validation service and data view
- Enhanced validation status delegate to prioritize and color-code statuses

## What's Next
1. Implement basic context menu logic (`_show_context_menu`).
2. Add tests for context menu behavior (basic menu structure).
3. Begin implementation of the base `CellDelegate`.
4. Add tests for `CellDelegate` base class.

## Known Issues
- Current DataView limitations (as documented before refactoring)
- *No new issues identified during current implementation.*
