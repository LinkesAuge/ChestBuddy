- Fixed test issues for `tests/test_recent_files_list.py` - resolved empty state widget visibility
- Successfully integrated MainWindow with the UI State Management system
- Resolved metaclass conflicts in UI State tests
- Fixed test imports and color reference issues

### UI Components
- Fixed progress dialog not closing properly
- Resolved issues with the data table view not updating
- Fixed multiple file import causing crashes
- Improved recent files list functionality
- Enhanced welcome screen with better state management

### Data Processing
- Fixed data validation not updating correctly
- Resolved issues with certain CSV formats not importing correctly
- Improved error handling during file operations

## Current Status

The application is now in active development with core functionality working as expected. The current focus is on implementing the UI State Management System to resolve persistent UI blocking issues. Test fixes and component integration are progressing well, with MainWindow integration completed and DataView integration in progress.

The application is usable for its primary functions, but certain issues remain with UI blocking and memory usage that are being actively addressed.
