# Project Progress

## Overall Status

ChestBuddy is currently undergoing a major architectural update, transitioning from a tab-based UI to a view-based architecture. This modernization makes the codebase more maintainable and extensible.

## What Works
- Core data model and data handling
- CSV data import and export
- Data validation engine with visualization
- Validation status display (valid, invalid, correctable)
- Data correction functionality
- Chart generation and visualization
- ChartView component fully integrated
- Configuration management system
- Basic navigation between views
- MainWindow core functionality
- ChartView unit tests passing
- ValidationTabView unit tests passing
- CorrectionView unit tests passing

## Recently Fixed
- Validation visualization system now correctly displays all validation statuses
- Proper integration between validation service and data view
- Enhanced validation status delegate to prioritize and color-code statuses

## Currently Being Worked On
- UI architecture update from tab-based to view-based
- MainWindow test updates (Phase 1 complete ✓, Phase 2 complete ✓, Phase 3 complete ✓)
- Test documentation and execution examples
- Signal management improvements
- Improved test patterns for controllers
- Test refactoring to support the new architecture
- Enhanced correction system implementation:
  - TableStateManager implementation (Phase 1 in progress)
  - Simplified correction display with original value, corrected value, and type
  - Total corrections counter
  - Batch processing with progress dialog

## What's Next
- Complete TableStateManager implementation (13 days planned)
- Implement recursive correction functionality (Phase 1 of correction improvement plan)
- Implement selection-based correction (Phase 2 of correction improvement plan)
- Complete auto-correction options (Phase 4 of correction improvement plan)
- Complete DashboardView implementation
- Replace remaining legacy UI components
- Extend signal connection tracking to all controllers
- Implement test utility for simplified controller mocking
- Add integration tests between controllers
