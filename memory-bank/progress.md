## Notes

### Implemented Features Details

#### Core Utilities
- **ConfigManager**: Singleton pattern implementation that manages application configuration, handles settings persistence, and provides type-safe access to configuration values.

#### Data Models
- **BaseModel**: Abstract base class with common model functionality and signal support.
- **ChestDataModel**: Core data model that manages the chest data using pandas DataFrame, emits signals for changes, and tracks validation and correction status.

#### Services
- **CSVService**: Handles reading and writing CSV files with advanced encoding detection and normalization, supporting international character sets including Japanese and European languages.
- **ValidationService**: Validates data against rules, tracks validation status, and provides methods to export validation reports.
- **CorrectionService**: Applies various correction strategies to data, maintains correction history, and provides methods to export correction reports.

#### UI Components
- **MainWindow**: Main application window with menu bar, toolbar, and tab widget.
- **DataView**: Displays and allows editing of data in a table view.
- **ValidationTab**: Displays validation issues and allows running validation with selected rules.
- **CorrectionTab**: Provides interface for applying corrections with various strategies.

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests for all core components, models, and services.
- **UI Tests**: Tests for UI components that verify proper initialization and behavior.
- **CSV Encoding Tests**: Specialized tests for various encoding scenarios, including international characters.
- **Test Data**: Sample valid and invalid data for testing validation, correction, and encoding.
- **Test Runner**: Script to run tests with coverage reporting.

### Current Blockers
None currently.

### Next Steps

## Notes

The CSV encoding enhancement phase has been completed successfully. The system now properly handles various encodings including UTF-8, Latin-1, Windows-1252, and Japanese encodings (Shift-JIS, CP932, EUC-JP). Key improvements include:

1. Multi-stage encoding detection with specialized handling for Japanese character sets
2. BOM detection for Unicode files (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32)
3. Comprehensive fallback chain for encoding attempts
4. Text normalization using ftfy library
5. Robust mode for handling corrupted files
6. Detailed error reporting

All tests (60 total) are now passing, including the new CSV encoding tests. The test suite verifies proper handling of:

1. UTF-8 files with German umlauts and special characters
2. Latin-1 and Windows-1252 encoded files
3. Shift-JIS files with Japanese characters
4. UTF-8 files with BOM
5. Mixed encoding files
6. Corrupted files
