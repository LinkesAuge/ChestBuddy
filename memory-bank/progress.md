## What Works (Existing Functionality)
- Core data model and data handling
- CSV data import and export
- Data validation engine
- Basic data correction functionality
- Chart generation and visualization
- Configuration management system
- Basic navigation between views
- MainWindow core functionality

## Recently Fixed
- Test collection errors related to imports
- Test failures in delegate tests due to super() calls
- Test failures in adapter tests due to placeholder logic/assertions

## What's Next
1. Refine Adapter transformation logic (`_transform_results`, `_transform_suggestions`).
2. Define and implement `TableStateManager` update methods.
3. Implement planned Phase 1 items (data loading, column handling, UI controls).
4. Implement advanced context menu features.

## Known Issues
- Current DataView limitations (as documented before refactoring)
- Large number of failing/erroring tests in older test suites (e.g., `main_window` tests) due to refactoring and missing dependencies.
