# ChestBuddy Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1-10: Core Functionality ✅
- Implemented core data model with pandas DataFrames
- Created services for CSV operations, validation, and correction
- Built basic UI with tabs for different functionality
- Implemented end-to-end workflows for data processing
- Added background processing for long-running operations
- Created configuration management system

### Phase 11: Validation Service Improvements ✅
- Fixed date parsing warnings in the ValidationService
- Added specific date format to `pd.to_datetime` calls
- Improved validation with configurable strictness levels
- Enhanced validation visualization in the UI

### Phase 12: Chart Integration ✅
- Implemented ChartService for various chart types (bar, pie, line)
- Fixed compatibility issues with PySide6 6.8.2.1
- Added chart customization options
- Integrated charts into the UI with proper data binding

### Phase 13: CSV Loading and Progress Reporting ✅
- Implemented MultiCSVLoadTask for handling multiple files

- **CSV Import**: Multi-file import with progress reporting and error handling
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation against reference lists
- **Correction Rules**: Application of correction rules with various matching options
- **Charts**: Multiple chart types with customization options

### User Interface
- **Navigation**: Sidebar navigation with data-dependent state handling
- **Dashboard**: Overview dashboard with empty state support
- **Data View**: Data table with filtering and sorting
- **Validation View**: Visual indicators for validation issues
- **Correction View**: Manual and automatic correction application
- **Chart View**: Interactive charts with filtering options

### Background Processing
- **Worker System**: Robust background worker implementation
- **Progress Reporting**: Detailed progress reporting with visual feedback
- **Cancellation**: Support for cancelling long-running operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful recovery from errors during file operations

### User Experience
- **Responsive UI**: Application remains responsive during processing
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for all operations
- **Consistent Design**: Unified style and interaction patterns
- **Error Messages**: Clear error messages with actionable information

## Technical Challenges

- **Memory Optimization**: Very large datasets (50,000+ rows) can still cause memory pressure
- **Thread Cleanup**: Minor thread cleanup warnings during application shutdown
- **UI Responsiveness**: Occasional UI freezes during extremely intensive operations
