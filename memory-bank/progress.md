## Correction System Improvements (In Progress)

### Current Status (2025-03-31)
- Fixed the error when applying corrections by removing the `recursive` and `selected_only` parameters from the service call
- The fix addressed the error but didn't implement the intended functionality
- Created a comprehensive plan for improving the correction system

### Next Steps
- Implement test-driven development approach for each improvement:
  1. Write tests for recursive correction
  2. Implement recursive correction in the controller
  3. Write tests for selection-based correction
  4. Implement selection-based correction
  5. Write tests for correctable status detection integration
  6. Implement correctable status detection
  7. Write tests for auto-correction options
  8. Implement auto-correction configuration and workflow integration

### Outstanding Issues
- Corrections are not being applied even though the error is fixed
- The recursive correction functionality is not implemented
- Selection-based correction is not implemented
- Correctable status detection needs to be integrated with validation
- Auto-correction options for validation and import are not implemented
