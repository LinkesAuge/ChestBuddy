### Application Architecture

The application architecture follows a clean controller-based organization:

1. **Core Layer**:
   - Models: ChestDataModel, ValidationModel
   - Services: CSVService, ValidationService, CorrectionService, ChartService
   - Controllers: FileOperationsController, ProgressController, ErrorHandlingController, ViewStateController, DataViewController, UIStateController
   - State: DataState, DataDependency

2. **UI Layer**:
   - MainWindow: Main application window (delegates to controllers)
   - Views: Dashboard, Data, Validation, Correction, Charts
   - Components: IUpdatable components, UpdatableComponent base class
   - Utils: UpdateManager for managing UI component updates

3. **Utils Layer**:
   - Configuration
   - Logging
   - File operations helpers
   - Signal management
   - Service location

### Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets (>100,000 rows) can consume significant memory
2. **UI Performance**: While signal throttling has improved the situation, updates to the UI thread can still cause momentary freezing with very large datasets
3. **Thread Cleanup**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown (non-critical)
4. **Controller Tests**: Some controller tests that require QApplication need to be updated to use pytest-qt
5. **QTimer Cleanup**: UpdateManager's `__del__` method needs to handle cases where timers are already deleted (fixed)

### Column Name Standardization

The application supports diverse CSV file formats through:

- Column name mapping to standardize input data (using `EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]`)
- Case-insensitive comparison for column identification
- Regular expression patterns for fuzzy matching similar columns
- Default column templates for easy mapping

    - Ensuring test mocks properly implement the IUpdatable protocol
    - Correcting test assertions to match the actual implementation behavior
- Phase 3: 📅 View Integration (Next)
- Phase 4: 📅 Data State Tracking (Future)

### Next Steps
1. Complete UpdateManager implementation with proper test coverage
2. Update existing views to implement the IUpdatable interface
3. Integrate the UpdateManager into the application
4. Add data state tracking to trigger UI updates automatically

## Implementation Details

### UI Update Interface
We're implementing a standardized approach to UI updates through:
- **IUpdatable** protocol: Defines a common interface for all updatable components
- **UpdateManager** utility: Manages component dependencies and debounces updates
- **UpdatableComponent** base class: Provides common implementation for UI components

### Recent Progress
- Fixed MockUpdatable in tests to properly implement the IUpdatable protocol
- Created QWidget-based MockUpdatableWidget for integration with QWidget-based components
- Adjusted test cases to properly verify UpdateManager functionality
- Modified test assertions to correctly test the actual implementation behavior

We have successfully fixed an issue in the UpdateManager data dependency integration tests:

1. **Fixed MockUpdatable in Integration Tests**
   - Modified MockUpdatable to inherit from UpdatableComponent base class instead of directly implementing IUpdatable
   - This resolved a TypeError caused by metaclass conflict
   - Updated test methods to use the correct method names:
     - Using `schedule_update` instead of `register_component`
     - Using `process_pending_updates` instead of `_process_updates` 
   - All tests in test_update_manager_data_dependency_integration.py now pass
   - This is an important step in completing Phase 4 (Data State Tracking) of the UI Update Interface implementation

The fix ensures that our mock implementations correctly follow the inheritance structure used in the actual code, making the tests more accurate and robust. This brings us closer to completing the integration testing for the Data State Tracking system.

### Current Issues
- The UpdateManager's handling of pending updates needed adjustment in tests
- The MockUpdatable class required QWidget implementation for complete testing
- Test assertions needed to be fixed to match the actual implementation

## Signal Management Enhancements
The SignalManager utility provides:
- Centralized signal connection tracking
- Prioritized connections for controlling execution order
- Connection type safety with parameter counting
- Throttled connections (both throttle and debounce modes)
- Debugging tools for connection inspection

### Signal Standards
We've established these guidelines:
- **Naming**: Consistent naming pattern (sender_action_target)
- **Connection**: Centralized connection management through SignalManager
- **Validation**: Type compatibility checking for all connections
- **Prioritization**: Execution order control for critical operations
- **Throttling**: Performance optimization for frequent UI updates

## Project Insights

The standardized update interface represents a significant improvement in:
1. **Consistency**: All UI components will follow the same update pattern
2. **Performance**: Debounced updates prevent UI freezing during rapid data changes
3. **Testability**: Standardized interface makes component testing easier
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code with clear update responsibility
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new updatable components

The current phase builds on the signal management improvements, focusing specifically on standardizing how UI components receive and process update requests.

## Recent Changes (2025-03-26)

### Code Cleanup
- Identified and removed an obsolete partial implementation of `DataViewAdapter` in `chestbuddy/ui/data_view_adapter.py`
- This file contained only two methods (`needs_refresh` and `refresh`) and wasn't being used anywhere
- The newer implementation in `chestbuddy/ui/views/data_view_adapter.py` correctly implements this functionality
- Updated `bugfixing.mdc` to document this cleanup operation

### DataView Import Button Fix
- Fixed issues with the import button in the DataView not functioning correctly
- Simplified the signal chain from button click through to the file dialog
- Corrected signal connections to ensure proper handling of button clicks
- Updated documentation to reflect the changes made

### Adapter Pattern Analysis
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the `DataView` and `DataViewAdapter` relationship
- Confirmed that `DataView` in `chestbuddy/ui/data_view.py` is still needed as it's actively used by `DataViewAdapter`
- Identified and documented the purpose of seemingly redundant methods between the two classes:
  - Methods like `populate_table()`, `enable_auto_update()`, and `disable_auto_update()` exist in both classes but serve different purposes
  - The adapter methods add controller integration, state management, and use the signal manager instead of direct updates
- Enhanced documentation in `systemPatterns.md` to include more detailed information about the adapter pattern implementation
- This analysis improves our understanding of the codebase and helps maintain proper architecture patterns

## Current Focus

### Data Population and UI Update Issues

We've resolved a series of issues related to data population and updates within the UI:

1. **Double Table Population Issue** - Fixed by disabling auto-update on the DataView component while ensuring the DataViewAdapter handles updates via the UpdateManager. This prevents redundant update paths.

2. **Missing Auto-Update Issue** - Fixed by explicitly enabling auto-update on the DataViewAdapter after disabling it on the DataView, ensuring proper data propagation.

3. **Initialization Order Issue** - Fixed by ensuring proper initialization sequence in component constructors, specifically moving the `enable_auto_update()` call after the parent class constructor.

#### Key Lessons Learned:

1. **Component Initialization Order** - When extending Qt/PySide6 classes, always ensure that parent class initialization (`super().__init__()`) is called before using any attributes or methods that might be initialized in the parent. This is especially critical for complex components with signal management.

2. **Signal Connection Patterns** - Maintain clear signal pathways to prevent redundant updates. When adapting existing components, carefully analyze all signal connections to ensure no duplicate update paths exist.

3. **Initialization Sequence Documentation** - Document initialization sequences in components, particularly those with complex hierarchies, to make future maintenance easier.

4. **Debugging Initialization Issues** - Initialization errors often manifest as attribute errors during application startup. Debugging these requires careful analysis of the constructor sequence and object lifecycle.

5. **Architecture Pattern Validation** - The adapter pattern we're using (wrapping DataView with DataViewAdapter) requires careful coordination of signals and events between layers. Having a visual diagram of these connections helps prevent issues.

### Implementation Guidelines for Component Initialization:

1. Always call `super().__init__()` before using any attributes that might be initialized by parent classes
2. Never call instance methods that rely on initialized attributes before the initialization is complete
3. Document the initialization sequence in complex components
4. For adapters or wrappers, carefully manage signal connections to prevent duplicate update paths
5. Use debug logging to trace initialization and update sequences in complex components

These lessons will guide our implementation of other adapter components and help prevent similar issues in the future.

## Recent Changes (2025-03-26)

### Code Cleanup
- Identified and removed an obsolete partial implementation of `DataViewAdapter` in `chestbuddy/ui/data_view_adapter.py`
- This file contained only two methods (`needs_refresh` and `refresh`) and wasn't being used anywhere
- The newer implementation in `chestbuddy/ui/views/data_view_adapter.py` correctly implements this functionality
- Updated `bugfixing.mdc` to document this cleanup operation

### DataView Import Button Fix
- Fixed issues with the import button in the DataView not functioning correctly
- Simplified the signal chain from button click through to the file dialog
- Corrected signal connections to ensure proper handling of button clicks
- Updated documentation to reflect the changes made

### Adapter Pattern Analysis
- Conducted a thorough analysis of the `DataView` and `DataViewAdapter` relationship
- Confirmed that `DataView` in `chestbuddy/ui/data_view.py` is still needed as it's actively used by `DataViewAdapter`
- Identified and documented the purpose of seemingly redundant methods between the two classes:
  - Methods like `populate_table()`, `enable_auto_update()`, and `disable_auto_update()` exist in both classes but serve different purposes
  - The adapter methods add controller integration, state management, and use the signal manager instead of direct updates
- Enhanced documentation in `systemPatterns.md` to include more detailed information about the adapter pattern implementation
- This analysis improves our understanding of the codebase and helps maintain proper architecture patterns
