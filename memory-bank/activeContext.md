# Current Focus

We are currently focused on enhancing the configuration management system to ensure its stability, reliability, and maintainability. This includes implementing comprehensive testing, improving error handling, and adding new features.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. Created a comprehensive test plan for the configuration system with over 35 test cases across 7 categories:
   - Settings Persistence
   - Configuration Export/Import
   - Reset Functionality
   - Error Handling
   - Settings Synchronization
   - ValidationService Integration
   - ConfigManager API

2. Implemented detailed unit tests for ConfigManager enhancements:
   - Boolean value handling with extensive parametrized tests
   - Error recovery for corrupted or missing config files
   - Configuration migration from older formats
   - Performance testing with large configurations

3. Enhanced ConfigManager.get_bool() method to support additional boolean formats:
   - Added support for 'Y'/'N' formats
   - Improved error handling for invalid values
   - Fixed case-insensitive comparison for boolean strings

4. Implemented ValidationService integration tests:
   - Created test_validation_service_config_integration.py
   - Tested initialization from configuration
   - Tested preference updates propagation
   - Tested signal emissions on preference changes
   - Tested case sensitivity and auto-save behaviors
   - Created a dedicated script for running these tests

## Current Work Focus

We're currently working on enhancing the testing framework for ChestBuddy. This includes:

1. **Test Infrastructure Enhancement**: 
   - Created multiple script runners for integration, validation, and all tests
   - Fixed all integration tests for `ValidationService` and `ConfigManager`
   - Fixed all unit tests for `ConfigManager` including boolean handling, migrations, and performance tests
   - Created a comprehensive `run_all_tests.py` script with filtering and coverage options

2. **Integration Testing Focus**:
   - Successfully implemented integration tests between `ValidationService` and `ConfigManager`
   - Ensured proper configuration loading, preference updates, and validation behavior
   - Added tests for configuration resets and auto-save behavior

3. **ConfigManager Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the `get_bool()` method to properly handle 'Y' and 'y' values
   - Added proper migration support for old configuration versions
   - Improved error handling for permission errors
   - Added methods to check for option existence and to reload configuration

4. **Test Documentation**:
   - Updated test plan with additional test cases
   - Documented test runner usage in scripts/README.md

## Recent Changes

- Fixed all integration tests for `ValidationService` and `ConfigManager` 
- Fixed all unit tests for `ConfigManager` including:
  - Boolean value handling (proper recognition of 'Y'/'y' as True)
  - Configuration version migration
  - Better error handling for permission errors
  - Performance testing for large configurations
- Added versatile test runners:
  - `run_integration_tests.py`: Runs only integration tests
  - `run_validation_integration_tests.py`: Runs validation service integration tests
  - `run_all_tests.py`: Comprehensive runner with options for test categories and coverage
- Added missing methods to `ConfigManager` class:
  - `has_option()`: Checks if an option exists in a section
  - `load()`: Reloads configuration from disk
  - `_perform_migrations()`: Handles upgrades from older config versions

## Current Tasks

1. **Testing the Configuration System**:
   - ✅ Created comprehensive test plan
   - ✅ Implemented unit tests for ConfigManager
   - ✅ Fixed boolean value handling in ConfigManager
   - ✅ Implemented ValidationService integration tests
   - Creating test scripts for manual testing
   - Performing manual testing according to the test plan
   - Documenting test results

2. **Addressing Non-Critical Issues**:
   - Monitoring for signal connection issues in application logs
   - Investigating Unicode encoding errors in logging system

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement ValidationService integration tests
2. Create test scripts/utilities for manual testing
3. Perform manual testing according to the test plan
4. Document test results and address any issues found
5. Update documentation for the configuration system components
6. Consider improvements to the settings UI based on testing feedback

## Technical Decisions

1. **Config System Testing Approach**:
   - Using a combination of automated unit tests and integration tests
   - Creating dedicated temporary directories for test configurations
   - Using mock objects for testing ValidationService integration
   - Implementing test scripts for reproducible manual testing

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Adding robust error recovery for corrupted configuration files
   - Implementing graceful fallback to defaults
   - Adding detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Ongoing Discussions

1. **Configuration UI Improvements**:
   - Considering adding a Config Debug view for developers
   - Evaluating the need for configuration schema versioning
   - Discussing backup/restore workflow improvements

2. **Validation System Extensions**:
   - Considering adding support for regex patterns in validation lists
   - Evaluating performance optimizations for large validation lists
