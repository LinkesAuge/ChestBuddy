# Active Development Context

*Last Updated: May 3, 2024*

## Current Focus

### Test-Driven Development for UI Components

We're currently implementing UI components for the correction feature following a test-driven development approach. Our primary focus is on ensuring all components pass their tests before integrating them into the main application flow.

#### Recently Completed:

- Successfully fixed and implemented the `CorrectionRuleView` component to pass all 16 tests
- Successfully fixed and implemented the `AddEditRuleDialog` component to pass all 12 tests
- Verified that the `ImportExportDialog` component passes all 16 tests

#### Key Implementation Fixes:
- Ensured attribute names in UI components match test expectations
- Properly implemented button state management based on selection state
- Correctly connected signals between UI elements
- Properly populated table data with appropriate user data for rule identification
- Fixed rule filtering, status bar updates, and delete confirmation functionality

#### Current Tasks:
- Implement integration between the correction components and the data view
- Verify or implement the `BatchCorrectionDialog` component
- Address any issues with the `CorrectionController` implementation and integration

#### Key Decisions:
- Continue with the test-driven development approach
- Prioritize components with existing tests that are failing
- Maintain proper signal connections between UI components and controllers
- Ensure consistent user experience across all dialog components

### Analyzing UI Components for Rule Management Using TDD

We've been examining the tests for `CorrectionRuleView` and `AddEditRuleDialog` to understand the expected behavior and implementation requirements. This analysis has revealed:

1. **Attribute Naming Discrepancies**: 
   - The tests expect specific attribute names that didn't match the implementation
   - For example, filter components (category, status, search) need specific names

2. **Button State Management**:
   - Tests expect buttons to be initially disabled
   - Buttons should enable/disable based on selection state

3. **Signal Connection Issues**:
   - The implementation needs proper signal connections for user actions
   - Signals for applying corrections, rule editing, etc. must include the expected parameters

4. **Rule Table Population**:
   - Rules need to be displayed in a specific order
   - Table items need appropriate user data for rule identification

We've successfully addressed these issues in the components, leading to all tests passing.

### Recent Changes

- Updated UI implementation to match test expectations
- Fixed signal connections and parameter passing
- Corrected button state management
- Ensured proper table population with user data

### Next Steps

1. **Data View Integration**:
   - Implement context menu integration for correction actions
   - Add cell highlighting based on correction status
   - Implement tooltips for correction information

2. **Batch Correction Dialog**:
   - Implement or fix the `BatchCorrectionDialog` component
   - Ensure it integrates properly with the correction controller

3. **Controller Integration**:
   - Verify proper functioning of the `CorrectionController`
   - Ensure background processing works correctly
   - Implement proper error handling and progress reporting

## Implementation Plan

The implementation is divided into phases:

### Phase 1: Core Data Model ✓
- Implement `CorrectionRule` and `CorrectionRuleManager`
- Create unit tests for model classes

### Phase 2: Services Layer ✓
- Implement `CorrectionService` with two-pass algorithm
- Add configuration integration
- Create unit tests for services

### Phase 3: Controller Layer ✓
- Implement `CorrectionController` and background worker
- Handle rule management operations
- Create unit tests for controller

### Phase 4: UI Components (In Progress)
- Create `CorrectionView` and rule table ✓
- Implement edit rule dialog ✓
- Implement batch correction dialog (Next)
- Add progress dialog for feedback (Next)

### Phase 5: Data View Integration (Upcoming)
- Add cell highlighting based on status
- Implement context menu integration
- Add tooltips for cell status

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (Final Phase)
- Create integration tests
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Ensure proper encoding support

## Test Status

- 436 passing tests
- 61 failing tests

### Test Categories:
- UI Component Tests: Most passing after recent fixes ✓
- Controller Tests: Some failures requiring investigation
- Integration Tests: Several failures - to be addressed in Phase 5
- Model Tests: All passing ✓
- Service Tests: All passing ✓

## Ongoing Discussions

- Implementation alignment with test expectations
- Performance considerations for large datasets
- Error handling strategies
- User experience refinement
