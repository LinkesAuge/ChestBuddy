# Active Development Context

*Last Updated: May 10, 2024*

## Current Focus

### Completing the CorrectionView UI Implementation

We're focusing on completing the CorrectionView UI implementation to match the mockup design. After comparing the current implementation with our mockup in `correction_feature_ui_mockup.html`, we've identified several gaps that need to be addressed:

#### Missing Features:
- Import/Export buttons in the header
- Dedicated status bar for CorrectionView
- Complete rule control buttons (Move Up/Down, Toggle Status)
- Settings panel with configuration options
- Context menu for rule actions

#### Current Tasks:
- Implement dedicated QStatusBar for CorrectionView
- Add Import/Export buttons to header with file dialog integration
- Create settings panel with configuration checkboxes
- Complete rule management buttons (Move, Toggle)
- Improve UI styling to match mockup

#### Next Steps:
- Add context menu for rule table
- Implement settings persistence via ConfigManager
- Enhance filter controls functionality
- Create unit tests for new UI components

#### Key Decisions:
- Replace MainWindow status bar usage with dedicated status bar
- Implement file dialog integration for rule import/export
- Connect settings to ConfigManager for persistence
- Follow UI component style guidelines from mockup

### Data View Integration for Correction Feature

We've been implementing the integration between the DataView and the correction components, with a focus on user experience and visual feedback. This work has involved:

1. **Context Menu Integration**: 
   - Added menu items for single and batch correction
   - Connected menu actions to appropriate dialogs
   - Implemented selection handling for both single and multiple cells

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Implemented cell highlighting based on correction status
   - Added tooltips to provide detailed information about corrections
   - Connected correction events to UI updates

3. **Controller Enhancements**:
   - Added methods to CorrectionController for data view integration
   - Implemented proper signal handling for correction events
   - Created interfaces for batch correction operations

4. **UI Flow Implementation**:
   - Implemented seamless flow from cell selection to correction creation
   - Added visual indicators for correction status
   - Connected correction application to UI refresh

### Recent Changes

- Updated DataView with context menu integration for corrections
- Enhanced CorrectionController with cell status methods
- Implemented cell highlighting and tooltips in DataView
- Connected BatchCorrectionDialog with selected cells
- Identified UI gaps in CorrectionView implementation

## Implementation Plan

The implementation is divided into phases:

### Phase 1: Core Data Model ✓
- Implement `CorrectionRule` and `CorrectionRuleManager`
- Create unit tests for model classes

### Phase 2: Services Layer ✓
- Implement `CorrectionService` with two-pass algorithm
- Add configuration integration
- Create unit tests for services

### Phase 3: Controller Layer ✓
- Implement `CorrectionController` and background worker
- Handle rule management operations
- Create unit tests for controller

### Phase 4: UI Components (In Progress)
- Create `CorrectionView` and rule table ✓
- Implement edit rule dialog ✓
- Implement batch correction dialog ✓
- Add progress dialog for feedback ✓
- Complete CorrectionView UI to match mockup:
  - Add dedicated status bar
  - Implement Import/Export buttons
  - Create settings panel
  - Complete rule management buttons
  - Add context menu for rules

### Phase 5: Data View Integration (In Progress)
- Add cell highlighting based on status ✓
- Implement context menu integration ✓
- Add tooltips for cell status ✓
- Complete end-to-end testing and refinement

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (Next)
- Create integration tests
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Ensure proper encoding support

## Test Status

- 448 passing tests (up from 408)
- 49 failing tests (down from 89)

### Test Categories:
- UI Component Tests: Most passing after recent fixes ✓
- Controller Tests: Some failures requiring investigation
- Integration Tests: Several failures - to be addressed in Phase 5
- Model Tests: All passing ✓
- Service Tests: All passing ✓

## Known Issues

1. **BatchCorrectionDialog Service Integration**
   - CorrectionService needs to implement apply_correction_to_cell method

2. **Cell Highlighting Performance**
   - Large datasets may experience performance issues with cell highlighting
   - Need to implement optimization for selective highlighting

3. **Missing Main Window Access**
   - CorrectionRuleView to DataView integration relies on app.get_main_window() which may not be available
   - Need to implement proper view communication mechanism

4. **Tooltip Display**
   - Multi-line tooltips may not display correctly in some scenarios
   - Consider formatting improvements for tooltip clarity

## Ongoing Discussions

- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Best approach for view communication
- Error handling strategies for correction operations
- User experience refinement for batch operations
