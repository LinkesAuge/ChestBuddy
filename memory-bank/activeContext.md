## Current Focus: CSV Import Progress Reporting Improvements

We've enhanced the progress reporting for CSV imports to provide a better user experience. The improvements address the issue of progress bars jumping from 0% to 100% and provide more detailed information during the import process. Key changes include:

1. **Incremental Progress Updates**:
   - Fixed progress bar jumping from 0% to 100% by implementing proper chunk-based progress reporting
   - Enhanced `MultiCSVLoadTask` to pass progress callbacks to `read_csv_chunked`
   - Added tracking of total rows loaded across multiple files

2. **Improved User Interface**:
   - Enhanced progress dialog to show detailed file and row information
   - Added formatted numbers with commas for better readability (e.g., "1,234" instead of "1234")
   - Implemented separate indicators for per-file progress and overall progress
   - Added file count information (e.g., "x / y files - z rows processed") for multi-file imports

3. **Simplified Progress Reporting**:
   - Removed row estimation in favor of showing only actual processed rows
   - Streamlined the progress display to "x / y files - z rows processed"
   - Improved final completion message clarity
   - Added processing state indication during data model updates

4. **Progress Pathways**:
   - Enhanced code pathways from background tasks to UI display
   - Updated `DataManager` to properly handle and forward progress signals
   - Improved `MainWindow._on_load_progress` to display comprehensive information
   - Enhanced initialization and cleanup of progress tracking variables

This work builds upon our previous stability improvements for CSV import functionality, creating a more robust and user-friendly experience when loading data.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Report Generation system using the robust data importing capabilities
2. Enhance the UI to support more flexible data exploration and summarization
3. Develop visualization components to represent the chest data effectively

## Recent Decisions

1. **Memory Management**: We've decided to take a more proactive approach to memory management, explicitly freeing resources and using garbage collection strategically to prevent memory issues with large datasets.

2. **Progress Reporting**: We've implemented a throttled approach to progress updates to avoid overwhelming the UI thread with signals.

3. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've enhanced error handling to provide more detailed feedback while ensuring the application remains stable even with corrupted input files.

4. **Testing Approach**: We've created a dedicated test script that simulates real application usage, allowing us to identify and address issues in a controlled environment.

## Implementation Details

- Thread safety issues were addressed primarily in `BackgroundWorker` and `MultiCSVLoadTask` classes
- Memory management improvements focus on the `CSVService.read_csv_chunked` method
- Error handling was enhanced throughout the codebase, especially in the CSV service layer
- Progress reporting was made more robust in the `MultiCSVLoadTask` class

## Recent Improvements

We have enhanced the progress dialog experience with a completely redesigned custom UI component system, focusing on:

1. **Reusable Components**
   - Created a dedicated widgets package for reusable UI components
   - Implemented ProgressBar as a standalone, reusable widget
   - Developed ProgressDialog as a wrapper around ProgressBar with extended functionality

2. **Visual Enhancement**
   - Modern, rounded design with gradient backgrounds
   - Color-coded states (blue for normal, green for success, red for error)
   - Percentage indicator with dynamic updates
   - Status text display for detailed information
   - Consistent styling with the application theme

3. **Behavioral Improvements**
   - Clear state transitions (normal â†’ success/error)
   - Proper error handling with visual feedback
   - Enhanced cancel button behavior based on context
   - Smoother animations and updates

4. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrated with existing MainWindow and DataManager
   - Maintained API compatibility while enhancing functionality
   - Added proper error state handling in App and MainWindow
   - Connected all relevant signals for a cohesive experience

## Next Steps: Report Generation System

With the CSV loading stability issues fully resolved and the UI components enhanced, we're now ready to begin implementing the Report Generation system. This will include:

1. **Report Templates Design**
   - Create standard report layouts for common data views
   - Define customizable elements within reports
   - Establish style guidelines for consistent reporting

2. **ReportService Implementation**
   - Develop a service for generating reports from data
   - Add PDF generation capabilities
   - Include chart embedding functionality
   - Implement export options for different formats

3. **ReportView UI Component**
   - Create a user interface for report configuration
   - Add report preview capabilities
   - Implement export options UI
   - Integrate with existing view system

4. **Integration with Existing Components**
   - Connect ChartService for visualization inclusion
   - Integrate with DataManager for data access
   - Add report generation to main application flow

## Active Decisions

1. **PDF Library Selection**: We need to identify the best PDF generation library that works well with PySide6. Currently considering reportlab, WeasyPrint, and PyFPDF.

2. **Chart Integration Approach**: Determining the best way to integrate charts into PDF reports - either as embedded images or dynamically generated elements.

3. **Report Template Structure**: Deciding between a fixed set of templates or a more flexible, configurable approach.

4. **UI Design for Report Configuration**: Working on how to present report options to users in an intuitive way.

## Current Issues and Considerations

2. **Memory Management**: Addressing memory pressure during report generation with large datasets and implementing streaming approaches where appropriate. Recent improvements to CSV import handling have provided a good pattern to follow for memory-efficient processing.

3. **User Experience Flow**: Designing an intuitive and efficient user flow for report generation.

4. **Test Strategy**: Developing a testing approach to verify visual output quality of the report generation system.

5. **Resolved Startup Issues**: Several issues affecting application startup have been fixed:
   - Removal of syntax error in `progress_bar.py` due to stray backticks.
   - Correction of incorrect import path for `DataView` in `main_window.py`.
   - Update of color constant in `progress_dialog.py` to use `TEXT_LIGHT` instead of non-existent `TEXT_PRIMARY`.

6. **CSV Import Robustness**: Addressed stability issues during CSV file import:
   - Improved memory management in the `read_csv_chunked` method to avoid memory exhaustion with large files.
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery options to allow partial data loading.
   - Added progress update throttling to reduce UI overhead.
   - Improved thread safety and signal handling for cross-thread communication.
   - Added proper cleanup of resources during cancellation and application shutdown.
   - Created specialized test script to validate CSV import functionality.
   - Fixed thread cleanup on shutdown to prevent "destroyed while still running" warnings.
   - Optimized progress reporting to balance feedback with performance.
