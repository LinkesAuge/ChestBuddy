## Current Focus

### Performance Optimization and Error Handling

Now that the test suite is fully operational with all tests passing, our focus is shifting to performance optimization and comprehensive error handling. Key areas to improve:

1. Optimizing data processing for large datasets.
2. Improving error handling for edge cases.
3. Enhancing the user interface for better usability.
4. Addressing the encoding issues with CSV files, especially for German umlauts.

We've successfully completed the test suite fixes that were previously blocking progress. All test files are now passing, including the UI component tests that required significant updates to match the current implementation.

**Current status:**
- All test files are now passing (50 tests total)
- Fixed API mismatches in test implementations
- Corrected method naming discrepancies 
- Improved test approach for UI components with proper mocking

**Completed test fixes:**
- Fixed method name mismatches in ChestDataModel and UI components
- Updated filtering tests to work with the correct API signature
- Fixed all QApplication handling issues in tests
- Corrected validation and correction status method calls

### Key APIs That Were Refactored

The main components that needed test updates:

1. **ChestDataModel**: 
   - Method signatures for filtering correctly use a dictionary parameter
   - Validation and correction status methods use simpler names

2. **UI Components**: 
   - Button and action names in tests now match implementation
   - Proper mocking of filter methods and UI updates

### Dependencies/Integration Points

- **Validation and Correction Services**: Tests now properly mock these services when testing UI components
- **QApplication**: Fixed handling between tests to avoid conflicts

### Next Steps

1. Implement performance optimizations for large datasets:
   - Improve filtering performance
   - Add pagination for large tables
   - Optimize validation and correction operations

2. Enhance error handling:
   - Implement comprehensive exception handling
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Improve logging for debugging

3. Address CSV encoding issues:
   - Add support for detecting and handling different encodings
   - Implement special handling for German umlauts and other special characters

4. Begin implementation of chart integration (Phase 8)

## Recent Changes
- Fixed all test files to match the current API implementation
- Corrected method naming inconsistencies in tests
- Improved approach to testing UI components with proper mocking
- Updated documentation to reflect current project status

## Key Issues
1. **CSV Encoding Issues**: The default input files have encoding issues that need to be resolved
2. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Need to optimize for better performance with large datasets
3. **Error Handling Improvements**: Need to enhance error handling for edge cases

## Active Decisions
- We will focus on performance optimization next, particularly for large datasets
- CSV encoding issues will be addressed with a more robust encoding detection and conversion mechanism
- We'll implement more comprehensive error handling across all components

## Critical Path
1. Implement performance optimizations for large datasets
2. Address CSV encoding issues
3. Enhance error handling
4. Begin chart integration

## Technical Context
With the test suite now fully functional, we have a solid foundation to build upon for further enhancements. Performance optimization will be particularly important as users may work with large datasets.

## Design Considerations
- Performance optimizations should not sacrifice maintainability
- Error handling should be user-friendly but also provide detailed information for debugging
- CSV encoding handling should be robust but also efficient
