# Active Context

Last updated: 2024-08-10

## Overview
This document captures the current state of the ChestBuddy project, focusing on the ongoing DataView refactoring effort.

## Recent Activities
- **Code Review Integration:** Incorporating feedback from the recent code review into the refactoring plan. Key areas addressed: potential confusion from coexisting old/new implementations, data model handling inefficiencies, and optimization of update logic.
- **Memory Bank Updates:** Updated `projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `progress.md` to align with the adjusted plan and reflect current understanding.
- **Integration Testing:** Completed initial integration tests for core correction flow (suggestion -> state update) and UI trigger -> service call.
- **Correction Action Flow:** Implemented the basic trigger flow from `CorrectionDelegate` click -> `DataTableView` signal -> `DataViewController` slot -> `CorrectionService.apply_ui_correction`.
- **Completed Correction Rule Preview Feature:** Successfully implemented the "Preview Rule" action in the `CorrectionRuleView`, including the context menu entry, controller logic, preview dialog, and comprehensive unit tests for all involved components.

## Current Focus
- **Testing and Integration (Phase 8):** Verifying the full correction application cycle, including the state update propagation back to the view. Adding unit tests for `CorrectionService.get_correction_preview`.
- **Architecture Refinement (Phase 5):** Analyzing the state update flow post-correction and planning signal decoupling.
- **Advanced Context Menu Features (Phase 4):** Planning implementation for remaining cell-type specific actions and validation during edit.

## Key Objectives (DataView Refactor)
- Implement a modular component architecture (Model, View, Controller, Delegates, Adapters, StateManager).
- Enhance validation status display and interaction.
- Integrate correction suggestions and application seamlessly.
- Improve context menu functionality and extensibility.
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
- Maintain high test coverage (>=95%).

## Recent Changes
- Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` with detailed completion status for Correction Rule Preview feature and tests.
- Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to reflect completion of Correction Rule Preview and shift focus.
- Completed unit tests for `CorrectionRuleView`, `CorrectionController`, and `CorrectionPreviewDialog` related to the preview feature.
- Fixed various test setup issues and errors encountered during preview feature implementation.

## Implementation Plan (High-Level Phases)
1.  **Phase 1:** Core DataViewModel and DataTableView implementation. (✅ Completed)
2.  **Phase 2:** Delegate system and basic Context Menu structure. (✅ Completed)
3.  **Phase 3:** Adapter integration (Validation & Correction). (✅ Completed)
4.  **Phase 4:** Advanced Context Menu Features (Correction Preview done, others in progress/planned).
5.  **Phase 5:** Architecture Refinement (In Progress).
6.  **Phase 6:** Import/Export and other Advanced Features (Planned).
7.  **Phase 7:** Performance Optimization (Planned).
8.  **Phase 8:** Testing and Integration (In Progress - core integration tests done, full cycle and service tests pending).
9.  **Phase 9:** Documentation and Cleanup (Planned).

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **State Management:** Reinforcing the `TableStateManager` as the single source of truth for view state, updated via Adapters and read by `DataViewModel`.
- **Signal Decoupling:** Planning to reduce direct signal connections between low-level delegates and high-level controllers. Views should emit higher-level signals.
- **Testing Strategy:** Continue TDD approach. Focus on integration tests for service interactions and full data flow cycles. Plan UI testing approach (e.g., `pytest-qt`).
- **Old Code Removal:** Plan for the eventual removal of `ui/data_view.py` and related adapters once the new implementation is fully integrated and verified (Phase 9).

## Technical Constraints & Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- PySide6
- Pandas
- UV for environment management
- pytest for testing

## Current Status Summary
- The core DataView refactoring (Phases 1-3) is largely complete, with fundamental display, interaction, and state management components implemented and unit-tested.
- Integration tests cover basic validation and correction suggestion flows, plus the UI trigger for correction application.
- The "Preview Rule" feature within the separate `CorrectionRuleView` is complete and fully unit-tested.
- Focus is now shifting towards:
    1.  Testing the `CorrectionService`'s preview method.
    2.  Verifying the *complete* correction cycle in integration tests (including state updates back to the view).
    3.  Refining the architecture based on recent learnings and review feedback.
    4.  Implementing the remaining advanced context menu features.

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1.  **Add Unit Tests for `CorrectionService.get_correction_preview`:** Ensure the service method itself is tested.
2.  **Implement Full Correction Cycle Integration Test:** Verify the `CorrectionService.apply_ui_correction` call leads to correct updates in `TableStateManager`, `DataViewModel`, and ultimately the view delegates.
3.  **Analyze Post-Correction State Flow:** Trace the state updates after a correction is applied to ensure the flow aligns with the intended architecture (`StateManager` -> `ViewModel` -> `Delegate`).
4.  **Plan Advanced Context Menu Features:** Detail the implementation for cell-type specific actions and validation-during-edit.
5.  **Plan Signal Decoupling Strategy:** Define how delegate signals will be replaced/managed by higher-level view signals.
6.  **Continue Architecture Refinement:** Address any identified issues in state flow or component interaction.

# Active Development Context (Legacy)

## Active Context - August 5, 2024

### DataView Refactoring Project Initiation

We are initiating a comprehensive refactoring of the DataView component, which is a central element of the ChestBuddy application responsible for displaying, validating, and allowing interaction with chest data. The current implementation has shown limitations in handling validation statuses, providing effective user interaction through context menus, and supporting advanced data manipulation features.

#### Refactoring Goals

1. **Implement a robust validation status display**:
   - Clear visual indicators for different validation statuses
   - Consistent mapping between validation results and cell states
   - Improved tooltip information for validation issues

2. **Enhance context menu functionality**:
   - Support for context-sensitive actions
   - Efficient handling of multi-selection operations
   - Integration with correction and validation workflows
   - Support for adding entries to correction and validation lists

3. **Improve data interaction**:
   - Support for bulk operations
   - Enhanced copy/paste functionality
   - Efficient cell editing workflow
   - Support for data import and export

4. **Refine architecture and performance**:
   - Clearer component boundaries
   - Improved performance with large datasets
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Better testability

#### Project Structure

The refactored DataView will follow a clear and logical folder structure:

```
chestbuddy/
├── ui/
│   ├── data/                       # DataView-specific components
│   │   ├── models/                 # Data models
│   │   ├── views/                  # View components
│   │   ├── delegates/              # Cell rendering delegates
│   │   ├── adapters/               # Adapter components
│   │   ├── menus/                  # Context menus
│   │   ├── widgets/                # Supporting UI widgets
│   │   └── data_view.py            # Composite view combining components
├── tests/
    ├── ui/
    │   ├── data/                   # Tests for DataView components
```

#### Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Core DataView Implementation**
   - Establish new folder structure
   - Implement base classes (DataViewModel, DataTableView)
   - Add core functionality (data loading, selection, columns, sorting, filtering, visibility)

2. **Phase 2: Context Menu Implementation**
   - Design context menu architecture
   - Implement standard actions
   - Add advanced functionality

3. **Phase 3: Validation and Correction Integration**
   - Implement validation status display
   - Connect to correction system
   - Add inline correction suggestions

4. **Phase 4: Import/Export and Advanced Features**
   - Implement import/export
   - Add search and filter
   - Optimize performance

#### Key Components Being Developed

1. **DataViewModel**: Adapts the core ChestDataModel for display in the UI
2. **DataTableView**: Main table view component with enhanced functionality
3. **CellDelegate**: Base rendering delegate with specialized subclasses
4. **ValidationDelegate**: Delegate for validation visualization
5. **CorrectionDelegate**: Delegate for displaying correction options
6. **ContextMenu**: Main right-click context menu with dynamic content
7. **ValidationAdapter**: Connect to ValidationService with UI integration
8. **CorrectionAdapter**: Connect to CorrectionService with UI integration

#### Current Status

We are actively working on the DataView refactoring. Key components like the `DataViewModel`, `

## Current Focus: DataView Refactoring (Phase 8 - Testing & Phase 5 - Refinement)

We are currently focused on Phase 8 (Testing and Integration) and Phase 5 (Architecture Refinement).

### Recent Activities:
- **Code Review Integration:** Incorporated feedback.
- **`ValidationAdapter` Integration:** Completed and tested.
- **`CorrectionAdapter` Integration:** Verified connection and fixed/passed integration tests for the suggestion flow.
- **UI Correction Action Trigger:** Implemented Delegate -> View -> Controller signal flow.
- **Correction Action Trigger Test:** Added and passed integration test verifying Controller calls Service method.

### Immediate Goals (Next 1-3 days):
1.  **Implement Full Cycle Correction Test:** Complete `test_correction_application_updates_state` implementation (verifying Model/ViewModel updates, acknowledging signal spy flakiness).
2.  **Analyze Post-Correction State Flow:** Add logging/trace the `TableStateManager -> DataViewModel -> Delegate` update path after a correction is applied via the service.

### Broader Context & Upcoming Steps:
- **Phase 5 Refinement:** Continue active review of the state management flow, plan signal decoupling.
- **Phase 4:** Address remaining Context Menu / Advanced UI features after Phase 5/8 progress.
- **Phase 8:** Plan UI tests.

### Key Decisions/Patterns Used Recently:
- **Service -> Adapter -> Manager:** Confirmed pattern.
- **Adapter Responsibility:** Transform service output for `TableStateManager`.
- **Integration Testing:** Using `patch.object(wraps=...)` for spying.
- **State Merging:** Using `dataclasses.asdict` and dictionary updates.

### Open Questions/Risks:
- **Performance:** Monitor performance.
- **State Synchronization:** Ensure perfect sync.
- **Performance:** Monitor performance as more complex state updates and painting occur, especially with larger datasets.
- **State Synchronization:** Ensuring perfect synchronization between the source model, `TableStateManager`, and the view, especially during rapid updates or model resets.
- **Complexity:** Managing the interactions between multiple components (ViewModel, StateManager, Adapters, Delegates, Services) requires careful testing and clear architecture.
