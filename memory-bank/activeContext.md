## Current Focus

We are currently focused on expanding test coverage for all functionality and UI components of the ChestBuddy application. With the successful implementation of background processing for CSV file operations and the optimization of memory usage for large datasets, we are now working to ensure that all features are thoroughly tested with comprehensive test coverage.

The implementation of MainWindow tests has been completed, providing comprehensive test coverage for menu actions, toolbar actions, tab switching, signal emission, and window state persistence. This represents a significant step forward in our test coverage expansion plan.

The next priorities are enhancing UI component tests, implementing integration tests for cross-component workflows, and creating end-to-end tests for typical user journeys.

## Active Decisions

1. **Test Coverage Strategy**: Focus on completing comprehensive UI tests before moving on to integration tests
2. **UI Testing Approach**: Use QtBot for simulating user interactions with UI components
3. **Integration Testing Scope**: Test key workflows that span multiple components
4. **Performance Testing**: Include tests for large datasets to verify performance optimizations
5. **Signal Testing**: Continue using the SignalCatcher approach for testing Qt signals

## Critical Path

1. Complete the enhancement of UI component tests with QtBot
2. Implement integration tests for cross-component workflows
3. Create end-to-end workflow tests
4. Enhance background processing tests for edge cases
5. Begin chart integration implementation (Phase 11)

## Design Considerations

1. **Test Coverage vs. New Features**: We are prioritizing test coverage to ensure stability before moving on to new features like chart integration
2. **Testing Complexity**: Balancing thorough testing with maintainable test code
3. **UI Testing Challenges**: Addressing the challenges of testing Qt UI components in an automated way
4. **Integration Test Design**: Creating realistic test scenarios that verify cross-component functionality
5. **Performance Testing Metrics**: Defining appropriate metrics for measuring and verifying performance
