# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on CSV encoding enhancement, particularly for handling international characters such as Japanese and German umlauts. We have implemented a robust CSVService that can handle various encodings and includes fallback mechanisms for problematic files.

Other focus areas include:
- Test suite maintenance and improvement
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Error handling enhancements

## Implementation Plan

We have recently completed the following phases:

1. **Test Phase (Completed)**
   - Created test files with various encodings (UTF-8, Shift-JIS, Windows-1252)
   - Implemented tests for different encoding scenarios
   - Identified issues with Japanese character encoding

2. **Implementation Phase (Completed)**
   - Enhanced the CSVService with better encoding detection
   - Added BOM detection for Unicode files
   - Implemented Japanese-specific detection and handling
   - Added robust mode for corrupted files
   - Created a fallback chain for encoding detection

3. **Next Phase**
   - Performance optimization for large datasets
   - Addressing ValidationService warnings
   - Enhancing error reporting and user feedback

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced `CSVService` to properly handle international characters and various encodings
- Added support for Japanese character sets (Shift-JIS, CP932, EUC-JP)
- Implemented BOM detection for Unicode files
- Added robust mode for handling corrupted CSV files
- Created a comprehensive test suite for CSV encoding functionality
- Fixed various method name mismatches in tests and implementation
- All 60 tests in the test suite now pass

## Current Status

- All tests are passing (60 tests total)
- CSV encoding detection is robust and handles international characters
- The core data model and service layer are functioning as expected
- UI components are working correctly and integrated with the data model

## Key Issues

1. **CSV Encoding**
   - Status: **Resolved** - The enhanced CSVService now handles various encodings properly
   - Solution: Implemented multi-stage encoding detection and fallback mechanisms

2. **Japanese Character Support**
   - Status: **Resolved** - Added specific detection for Japanese encodings and character sets
   - Solution: Implemented bytewise detection and character verification

3. **Test Suite**
   - Status: **Resolved** - All tests are now passing
   - Solution: Updated tests to match current implementation

4. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Status: **In Progress** - Need to implement caching and streaming for large CSV files
   - Approach: Will use chunked reading and memory-efficient processing

## Active Decisions

1. **Encoding Detection Approach**
   - Decision: Use a multi-stage approach with library detection, custom detection, and fallback chain
   - Rationale: Provides maximum compatibility and robustness

2. **Internationalization**
   - Decision: Support UTF-8, Western European, and East Asian encodings by default
   - Rationale: Covers most use cases in target markets (Germany and Japan)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Decision: Provide detailed error messages and recovery options
   - Rationale: Improves user experience when dealing with problematic files

## Critical Path

1. âœ… Enhance CSV encoding detection
2. âœ… Add robust mode for corrupted files
3. âœ… Create comprehensive tests for encoding handling
4. ðŸ”„ Optimize performance for large datasets
5. ðŸ”„ Improve error reporting and user feedback
6. ðŸ”„ Address validation service warnings

## Design Considerations

1. **Performance vs. Robustness**
   - The enhanced CSVService prioritizes robustness over performance
   - For very large files, we will need to implement streaming and chunked processing

2. **User Experience**
   - Error messages should be clear and actionable
   - The UI should provide feedback during long operations

3. **Maintainability**
   - Error handling logic is centralized in service classes
   - Test coverage is comprehensive to catch regressions
