   - Correction of incorrect import path for `DataView` in `main_window.py`.
   - Update of color constant in `progress_dialog.py` to use `TEXT_LIGHT` instead of non-existent `TEXT_PRIMARY`.

6. **CSV Import Robustness**: Addressed stability issues during CSV file import:
   - Improved memory management in the `read_csv_chunked` method to avoid memory exhaustion with large files.
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery options to allow partial data loading.
   - Added progress update throttling to reduce UI overhead.
   - Improved thread safety and signal handling for cross-thread communication.
   - Added proper cleanup of resources during cancellation and application shutdown.
   - Created specialized test script to validate CSV import functionality.
   - Fixed thread cleanup on shutdown to prevent "destroyed while still running" warnings.
   - Optimized progress reporting to balance feedback with performance.

### Column Name Standardization

We've updated the `ChestDataModel.EXPECTED_COLUMNS` to match the actual column names in our standard CSV file (`Chests_input_test.csv`). The columns are now defined using uppercase names:

```python
EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]
```

Previously, we were using title case column names like "Player Name", but our CSV files actually use uppercase names like "PLAYER". This mismatch was causing data to not display properly in the table view.

We've also updated the `DataManager._map_columns` method to include a default mapping between old column names and new ones to maintain compatibility with existing code that might be using the old column names.

Tests have been updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that all references to column names use the new uppercase format.

### CSV Operations Refactoring 

### Multi-Cell Paste Enhancement

We've improved the user experience by implementing multi-cell paste functionality, allowing users to select multiple cells in the table and paste content to all of them simultaneously. The key improvements include:

1. Modified the `_paste_cell` method in `DataView` to handle multiple selections
2. Added a context menu option that shows "Paste to all X selected cells" when multiple cells are selected
3. Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+V) for paste operations
4. Added better logging for paste operations to improve debugging

This enhancement allows for more efficient data entry and editing, especially when the same value needs to be applied to multiple cells. Users can now:

1. Select multiple cells by clicking and dragging or using Ctrl+click for non-adjacent selections
2. Press Ctrl+V or use the right-click context menu to paste to all selected cells
3. See immediate feedback as all selected cells are updated simultaneously

### Column Name Standardization 

## Current Focus: CSV Loading Improvements

We are implementing enhancements to the CSV file loading process to improve performance and user experience with large files. The current implementation causes the application to freeze during loading with no visual feedback.

### Implementation Plan for CSV Loading Improvements

1. **Create MultiCSVLoadTask Class**
   - Create a new class extending BackgroundTask
   - Handle loading multiple files with progress reporting
   - Use chunked reading for better memory efficiency

2. **Update DataManager**
   - Add new signals:
     - `load_progress(str, int, int)` for file name, current progress, total
     - `load_started()` and `load_finished()` for UI feedback
   - Modify `load_csv` to use the new task
   - Implement cancellation support

3. **Add Progress Dialog in MainWindow**
   - Create QProgressDialog when loading starts
   - Update the dialog as loading progresses
   - Support cancellation with proper cleanup
   - Close dialog when loading completes

4. **Use Efficient File Processing**
   - Switch from `read_csv` to `read_csv_chunked` or `read_csv_background`
   - Process files in manageable chunks
   - Report progress based on chunks processed

5. **Implement Proper Cancellation**
   - Allow users to cancel long-running operations
   - Clean up resources when canceled
   - Update UI appropriately after cancellation

### Expected Benefits
- UI remains responsive during file loading
- Users see visual progress indication
- Users can cancel operations if needed
- Better memory management with chunked reading
- Improved performance for large files

### Current Tasks
- [ ] Create MultiCSVLoadTask class
- [ ] Update DataManager with new signals and methods
- [ ] Add progress dialog to MainWindow
- [ ] Implement proper chunked file loading
- [ ] Add cancellation support
- [ ] Create tests for new functionality
