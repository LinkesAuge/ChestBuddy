# Current Development Focus

## Configuration Management System Enhancement

We are currently focused on enhancing the configuration management system in ChestBuddy to ensure reliable settings persistence, validation, and user-friendly interaction. This includes several key areas:

### Recent Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Critical Application Startup Issues**
   - Resolved `MainWindow` missing `_config_manager` attribute error by properly passing the config manager instance from app.py to MainWindow
   - Added missing color constants `DANGER_BG` and `DANGER_ACTIVE` to the Colors class to fix UI styling issues
   - These fixes allowed the application to start successfully without crashing

2. **Enhanced ConfigManager Functionality**
   - Added robust error handling for corrupted configuration files
   - Implemented comprehensive reset_to_defaults functionality that supports both global and section-specific resets
   - Created validate_config method to check configuration integrity
   - Added export_config and import_config methods for backup and restore capabilities
   - All tests for ConfigManager now pass successfully

3. **Fixed Settings Synchronization Between Views**
   - Resolved issue where validation settings changed in one view weren't reflected in the other
   - Added proper signal handling for ValidationService's validation_preferences_changed signal
   - Enhanced SettingsTabView to directly update ValidationService when validation settings change
   - Improved reset and import functionality to properly synchronize all components
   - Added signal blocking to prevent feedback loops during UI updates
   - Added missing auto-save feature to ValidationTabView
   - Implemented auto-save property and related methods in ValidationService
   - Ensured all settings are consistently synchronized between views

### Current Tasks

1. **Testing Configuration System Stability**
   - Verifying settings persistence across application restarts
   - Testing configuration validation in edge cases
   - Ensuring proper error recovery when configuration becomes corrupted

2. **Addressing Non-Critical Issues**
   - Monitoring application logs for warning messages related to signal connections
   - Investigating UpdateManager service registration warnings
   - Looking into Unicode encoding errors in the logging system

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive testing of configuration system
2. Address identified non-critical issues
3. Update documentation for the configuration system components
4. Consider improvements to the settings UI based on testing feedback

## Application Architecture Review

As part of our ongoing development, we're conducting a review of the ChestBuddy architecture to identify areas for improvement:

### Key Observations

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Some components have tight coupling that should be reduced
   - Service instantiation and dependency injection need more consistency
   - The current approach mixes direct instantiation with service location in some components

2. **Signal Flow**
   - Signal connections between components should be better documented
   - Some signal emissions may be redundant or inefficient
   - Need to ensure consistent signal naming patterns

### Architectural Principles

We are reinforcing these architectural principles in current development:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI components should focus solely on presentation
   - Business logic should reside in services
   - Data management should be handled by dedicated components

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Components should declare dependencies explicitly
   - Services should be provided through constructor injection
   - ServiceLocator is used for cases where direct injection is impractical

3. **Configuration as a Service**
   - Configuration should be treated as a core service
   - All configurable components should receive config through injection
   - Default configurations should be well-documented

## Technical Debt

The following technical debt items have been identified and are being tracked:

1. **Code Duplication in UI Components**
   - Several tab views contain similar initialization patterns
   - Consider creating a base tab view with common functionality

2. **Error Handling**
   - Error handling is inconsistent across components
   - Need standardized approach for user-facing errors

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - More comprehensive tests needed for UI components
   - Service integration tests should be expanded

## Documentation Status

The following documentation is being maintained:

1. **Class and Module Documentation**
   - All new classes have docstrings
   - Need to improve existing class documentation

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Component interaction diagrams should be updated
   - Need to document service relationships more clearly

3. **User Documentation**
   - Settings documentation needs updating with new features
   - Operation guides should be expanded
