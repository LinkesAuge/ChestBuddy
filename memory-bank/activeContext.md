# Current Focus

We are currently focused on implementing end-to-end workflow tests for the ChestBuddy application. We have successfully implemented the basic test structure and are now addressing challenges with UI component testing in an automated environment. Our focus is on creating tests that verify core functionality without becoming brittle or dependent on specific UI implementations.

## Implementation Plan

We are following a phase-based implementation approach:

- âœ… Phase 1: CSV Encoding Enhancement
- âœ… Phase 2: Test Suite Maintenance
- âœ… Phase 3: UI Optimizations
- âœ… Phase 4: Background CSV Processing
- âœ… Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Test Coverage Expansion
  - âœ… Tests for MainWindow functionality
  - âœ… Enhanced UI component tests with QtBot
  - âœ… Integration tests for cross-component workflows
  - ðŸ”„ End-to-end workflow tests
  - â¬œ Background processing tests
  - â¬œ Performance tests

## Recent Changes

- Created a new test_workflows.py file for end-to-end workflow testing
- Implemented basic functionality tests for ChestDataModel without UI dependencies
- Created a simplified approach to testing Qt components that avoids UI deadlocks
- Resolved issues with test fixtures and method name mismatches (rowCount vs row_count, update_value vs update_data)
- Identified and addressed challenges with testing UI components in automated environments:
  - Signal/slot connections that can cause deadlocks
  - UI components that require user interaction or file dialogs
  - Qt event loop processing in automated tests

## Current Status

- Basic functionality tests are passing
- UI component testing approach has been simplified to avoid deadlocks
- Test coverage for core data model functionality is implemented
- Integration between components is being tested with a focus on API compatibility
- End-to-end workflow tests are under development

## Key Issues

- Test Suite: In Progress ðŸ”„
  - Basic tests are passing
  - UI component tests have been enhanced with QtBot
  - Integration tests are now implemented and passing
  - End-to-end workflow tests need refinement
  - Need to address UI component testing challenges
- Performance: Mostly Resolved âœ…
  - Background processing implemented
  - Memory optimization complete
  - No remaining significant performance issues
- UI: Resolved âœ…
  - All components are functional
  - UI is responsive
- Encoding Detection: Resolved âœ…
  - Robust algorithm implemented
  - Handles edge cases

## Active Decisions

- End-to-End Testing Strategy: We are implementing a pragmatic approach that:
  - Focuses on core functionality verification without complex UI interactions
  - Creates separate test classes for different testing scopes (basic functionality, UI components)
  - Avoids testing patterns that lead to deadlocks or brittle tests
  - Uses simplified UI component initialization where possible

- UI Testing Approach: We have adjusted our approach to:
  - Test core data model functionality separately from UI
  - Use minimal UI components in tests to avoid complex signal/slot interactions
  - Focus on verifying that core functionality works rather than testing every UI interaction
  - Implement strategic direct testing of critical UI components

- Integration Testing Strategy: We have implemented integration tests that focus on:
  - Direct data model operations and signal emission
  - Component initialization and relationships
  - Basic UI functionality without complex interactions
  - Avoiding brittle UI tests that depend on specific widget structures

- Performance Testing: We will include performance tests to ensure:
  - Background processing works correctly
  - Memory usage remains optimized
  - UI remains responsive during heavy operations

## Critical Path

1. âœ… Implement MainWindow tests
2. âœ… Enhance UI component tests with QtBot
3. âœ… Implement integration tests for cross-component workflows
4. ðŸ”„ Create end-to-end workflow tests
   - âœ… Basic data model functionality
   - âœ… Simple Qt component tests
   - ðŸ”„ Full workflow tests with minimal UI interaction
5. â¬œ Add background processing tests
6. â¬œ Implement performance tests

## Design Considerations

- Balance between test coverage expansion and new feature implementation
- Ensuring tests remain maintainable and don't become brittle
- Focus on user experience and actual usage patterns in tests
- Test-driven approach for future development
- Prefer resilient tests that can adapt to UI changes over brittle tests
- Use process_events() to ensure Qt event loop processing in UI tests
- Consider refactoring UI components for better testability where appropriate
