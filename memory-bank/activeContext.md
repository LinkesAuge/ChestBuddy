# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently focused on enhancing the test coverage of the application and improving its performance when handling large CSV files. This includes:

1. **Background CSV Processing**: Implementing background processing for CSV file reading to prevent UI freezing when loading large files
   - BackgroundWorker implementation for thread management
   - CSVReadTask for asynchronous CSV file reading
   - Signal-based progress reporting and cancellation support
   - Memory management for large files through chunked reading

2. **Test Coverage Expansion**: Creating a comprehensive test suite to ensure application reliability
   - Unit tests for core services and models
   - UI component tests with QtBot
   - Background processing tests
   - Integration tests for cross-component functionality
   - End-to-end workflow tests for complete user scenarios
   - Performance tests for large dataset handling

3. **UI Testing Framework**: Establishing robust testing practices for UI components
   - Implementing proper cleanup mechanisms for UI tests
   - Using QtBot for simulating user interactions
   - Creating reusable fixtures for UI component testing
   - Ensuring thread safety in UI tests

   - Considering scalability with increasing dataset sizes
   - Prioritizing user experience with responsive UI

## Current Blockers

1. **Test Environment Stability**:
   - Some race conditions in background task tests
   - Occasional resource cleanup issues in test teardown
   - Need for more robust test fixtures for UI components

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**:
   - Memory consumption with very large CSV files
   - Processing speed for complex operations on large datasets
   - Need for more efficient data structures for some operations
