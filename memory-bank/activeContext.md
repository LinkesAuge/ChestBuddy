# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on performance optimization for large datasets. We have successfully implemented CSV chunked reading functionality and now need to focus on the remaining performance optimization tasks.

Key focus areas include:
- âœ… Implementing chunked reading for large CSV files
- Adding background processing for time-consuming operations
- Optimizing memory usage for large datasets
- Adding progress indicators for long-running operations
- Addressing ValidationService date parsing warnings

## Implementation Plan

We have recently completed the following phases:

1. **CSV Encoding Enhancement (Completed)**
   - Implemented multi-stage encoding detection with chardet and charset-normalizer
   - Added Japanese-specific detection patterns
   - Implemented BOM detection for Unicode files
   - Created a comprehensive fallback chain for various encodings
   - Added robust mode for handling corrupted files
   - Added extensive tests for various encoding scenarios

2. **Test Suite Maintenance (Completed)**
   - Fixed method name mismatches between tests and implementation
   - Updated tests to align with current API
   - Added tests for international character handling
   - All 60 tests now pass successfully

3. **Current Phase: Performance Optimization (In Progress)**
   - âœ… Implemented chunked reading for large CSV files
   - âœ… Added progress reporting callback mechanism
   - âœ… Created comprehensive tests for chunked reading functionality
   - Planning background processing implementation for UI responsiveness
   - Exploring additional memory optimization techniques
   - Designing progress indicators for long-running operations

4. **Next Phase**
   - Chart integration
   - Report generation
   - User interface enhancements

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced `CSVService` with chunked reading functionality for large CSV files
- Added progress callback mechanism for reporting progress during long operations
- Created comprehensive tests for chunked reading in `test_csv_performance.py`
- Implemented pre-validation of CSV structure before processing
- Added memory-efficient processing for large files
- Enhanced `CSVService` to properly handle international characters and various encodings
- Added support for Japanese character sets (Shift-JIS, CP932, EUC-JP)
- Implemented BOM detection for Unicode files
- Added robust mode for handling corrupted CSV files
- Created a comprehensive test suite for CSV encoding functionality
- Fixed various method name mismatches in tests and implementation
- All 66 tests in the test suite now pass

## Current Status

- All tests are passing (66 tests total)
- CSV encoding detection is robust and handles international characters
- Chunked reading functionality is implemented for handling large files
- The core data model and service layer are functioning as expected
- UI components are working correctly and integrated with the data model
- Performance with large datasets has been improved with chunked reading

## Key Issues

1. **CSV Encoding**
   - Status: **Resolved** - The enhanced CSVService now handles various encodings properly
   - Solution: Implemented multi-stage encoding detection and fallback mechanisms

2. **Japanese Character Support**
   - Status: **Resolved** - Added specific detection for Japanese encodings and character sets
   - Solution: Implemented bytewise detection and character verification

3. **Test Suite**
   - Status: **Resolved** - All tests are now passing
   - Solution: Updated tests to match current implementation

4. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Status: **Partially Resolved** - Implemented chunked reading for large CSV files
   - Remaining: Add background processing and UI progress indicators

5. **ValidationService Date Parsing Warnings**
   - Status: **To Do** - Need to address warnings in test suite
   - Approach: Specify date format in pd.to_datetime calls

## Active Decisions

1. **Background Processing Approach**
   - Decision: Research and select appropriate method for background processing
   - Rationale: Needs to maintain UI responsiveness while performing heavy operations

2. **Progress Indicator Implementation**
   - Decision: Design UI component for displaying progress
   - Rationale: Provides user feedback during long operations

3. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Decision: Create a unified error handling approach across all components
   - Rationale: Provides consistent user experience and simplifies debugging

4. **Chart Integration Strategy**
   - Decision: Research and select appropriate charting library
   - Rationale: Need to balance functionality, performance, and ease of integration

## Critical Path

1. âœ… Enhance CSV encoding detection
2. âœ… Add robust mode for corrupted files
3. âœ… Create comprehensive tests for encoding handling
4. âœ… Implement chunked reading for large CSV files
5. ðŸ”„ Implement background processing for time-consuming operations
6. ðŸ”„ Add progress indicators for long-running operations
7. ðŸ”„ Address validation service warnings
8. ðŸ”„ Implement chart integration

## Design Considerations

1. **Performance vs. Robustness**
   - The enhanced CSVService prioritizes robustness over performance
   - Chunked reading balances memory efficiency with processing speed
   - Progress reporting enables better user experience with large files

2. **User Experience**
   - Error messages should be clear and actionable
   - The UI should provide feedback during long operations
   - Progress indicators are needed for time-consuming tasks

3. **Maintainability**
   - Error handling logic should be centralized in service classes
   - Test coverage is comprehensive to catch regressions
   - Performance optimizations should not sacrifice code clarity
