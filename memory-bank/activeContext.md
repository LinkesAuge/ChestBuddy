# Current Focus

The active development focus is UI enhancement with a particular emphasis on dashboard components and user experience improvements. Our current initiatives include:

## UI Enhancement Phases

1. **Building Reusable Components**: Creating a library of consistent, styled UI components that can be reused across the application.
2. **Enhancing Navigation**: Improving the sidebar navigation and ensuring consistent data state awareness across all views.
3. **Redesigning Dashboard**: Implementing a modern, card-based dashboard with actionable insights and quick access to key functions.
4. **Optimizing Data Views**: Improving table views, charts, and visualizations for better information presentation.
5. **Improving User Feedback**: Enhancing progress indication, error reporting, and status messaging throughout the application.

## Recent Decisions

### UI Framework Decisions
- Using PySide6 for all UI components for modern styling capabilities
- Implementing a component-based architecture for better reusability
- Adopting signals/slots pattern for loose coupling between components
- Following a card-based UI pattern for dashboard elements
- Using CSS-based styling for consistent theming

### Implementation Strategy
- Creating adapter classes to connect views with data models
- Using factory methods for UI component creation
- Implementing responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Centralizing style definitions for consistency
- Using a state management pattern for complex UI states

### Major Bugfixes

1. Fixed issues with progress dialog not showing during file loading
2. Fixed data display problems in table view after loading
3. Fixed multiple file import crashes with improved progress handling
4. Improved progress dialog UI and feedback during import operations
5. Fixed various UI blocking issues, especially after confirming the first import:
   - Sixth attempt solution: Removed automatic view transition mechanism to simplify the code
   - Kept robust UI unblocking with additional event processing and UI element re-enabling
   - Followed a simplification approach rather than adding more complexity
   - Focused solely on ensuring UI responsiveness after dialog closure
   - Seventh attempt solution: Added a delayed final UI check to handle race conditions between dialog closure and table population
   - Implemented two-phase UI unblocking (immediate at closure + delayed check 500ms later)
   - This ensures UI elements remain enabled even if they get temporarily disabled during table population
   - Eighth attempt solution: Implemented multiple delayed UI checks at increasing intervals (500ms, 1500ms, 3000ms, 5000ms)
   - This significantly increases our chances of catching the end of the table population process, especially for large datasets
   - Enhanced the checks to re-enable all UI elements, not just the table view
   - Added better diagnostic logging to track when each check runs and what it finds

## Known Issues

### UI Interaction Issues
- ✅ Resolved
- Description: Progress dialog wasn't appearing during file imports, UI remained blocked after loading completed, and progress dialog was updated twice during table population
- Root cause: Improper handling of progress dialog creation, UI updates after data loading, and lack of dialog state tracking
- Fix: Updated MainWindow methods to properly show progress dialog, unblock UI elements after loading, and added a flag to prevent multiple updates to the dialog
- Validation: Progress dialog now appears during imports, UI elements are properly enabled after loading, and dialog is only updated once during the import process

### Performance Issues
- ⚠️ Status: Investigating
- Description: UI becomes unresponsive during heavy data operations
- Root cause: Blocking operations in UI thread and suboptimal threading model
- Planned fix: Implement better threading model and background processing

### Chart Export Quality
- ⚠️ Status: Investigating
- Description: Charts lose quality when exported to PDF
- Root cause: Vector rendering issues in chart export
- Planned fix: Implement proper vector-based chart export

- Quality Assurance: Ensuring robust error handling and stability

### Major Bugfixes
We've addressed several critical bugs in the import functionality:

1. **Fixed double data processing** - Data was being processed twice during import, causing UI lag and duplicate operations. Fixed by removing redundant signal emission in the DataManager.

2. **UI unblocking issues** - Improved the MainWindow._on_load_finished method to ensure the UI is properly unblocked after loading data, especially when using the menu bar's "Open" option.

3. **Import action consistency** - Standardized all import actions throughout the application to ensure they all emit consistent "import" signals. This includes:
   - Dashboard action cards now map "import_csv" to "import"
   - All empty state widgets use the same signal pattern
   - Menu actions connect properly to the standard import handler

4. **Logger integration** - Added proper logging to the dashboard adapter to provide better debugging information.

5. **Progress dialog confirmation UI blocking** - Fixed issue where the UI would remain blocked after clicking "Confirm" on the import progress dialog (only on first import). Improved the fix by properly sequencing event processing and dialog reference cleanup to ensure the dialog's events are fully processed before removing the reference.

## Current Development Focus

### UI Blocking Issue Investigation

We've identified a persistent UI blocking issue that occurs specifically after the first import of data but not in subsequent imports. To address this issue, we've implemented an enhanced debugging plan:

1. **Enhanced Logging Strategy**
   - Added detailed timestamped logs across the import flow
   - Implemented logging for dialog visibility states
   - Added logging for UI component states, particularly the DataView table
   - Added contextual tags to log messages for easier filtering and analysis

2. **State Tracking and Comparison**
   - Implemented a `StateSnapshot` system to capture application state at key points
   - Added comparison functionality to identify state differences between snapshots
   - Capturing snapshots before/after each import and dialog closure

3. **Performance and Event Monitoring**
   - Added timing metrics for performance-critical operations
   - Implemented event tracing to identify blocked or delayed UI events
   - Created tooling to inspect event processing and UI component states

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Added an emergency "rescue" functionality via F12 hotkey that opens a debugger dialog
   - Implemented a UI component inspector to examine widget hierarchy and states
   - Added tools to force-enable UI components and process pending events

The debugging strategy aims to identify the exact differences between the first and subsequent imports that cause the UI to remain blocked after the first import but work correctly in subsequent imports.

### Current Hypotheses

Based on investigation so far, we have several hypotheses:

1. **Table Enabling Timing**: The DataView's table may be disabled during data population but not properly re-enabled during the first import.
2. **Event Processing**: There may be pending events that aren't properly processed during the first import sequence.
3. **Modal Dialog Issues**: The progress dialog's modality may be affecting the UI differently on first vs. subsequent imports.
4. **View Transition Race Condition**: The transition to the Data view may be occurring before the UI is fully ready during the first import.

Our enhanced logging should help identify which of these is the root cause.
