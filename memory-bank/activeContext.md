# Active Development Context

*Last Updated: May 10, 2024*

## Current Focus

### Test-Driven Development for Correction Feature

We're continuing to implement the correction feature following a test-driven development approach. Our recent focus has been on completing the UI components and integrating them with the data view for a seamless user experience.

#### Recently Completed:

- Successfully implemented the BatchCorrectionDialog component, passing all 12 tests
- Integrated the correction feature with DataView through:
  - Context menu actions for creating rules from selected cells
  - Cell highlighting based on correction status
  - Tooltips showing correction information
- Enhanced CorrectionController with methods to support data view integration:
  - get_correction_status() - for cell status information
  - get_applicable_rules() - for finding applicable rules
  - apply_rules_to_selection() - for batch correction

#### Key Implementation Fixes:
- Connected context menu actions to correction dialogs
- Implemented cell highlighting based on correction status:
  - Red for invalid cells without correction rules
  - Orange for invalid cells with correction rules
  - Green for corrected cells
- Added tooltips showing original values, corrections, and rule information
- Connected data view to BatchCorrectionDialog for selected cells

#### Current Tasks:
- Complete end-to-end testing of data view integration
- Address potential performance issues with cell highlighting
- Fix CorrectionService apply_correction_to_cell method implementation
- Resolve view communication mechanism for getting selected cells

#### Next Steps:
- Create integration tests for the correction feature
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Ensure proper encoding support for all operations
- Address remaining UI component test failures

#### Key Decisions:
- Continue with the test-driven development approach
- Prioritize visual feedback for correction status through highlighting
- Use tooltips to provide detailed correction information
- Implement batch operation capabilities for better user experience

### Data View Integration for Correction Feature

We've been implementing the integration between the DataView and the correction components, with a focus on user experience and visual feedback. This work has involved:

1. **Context Menu Integration**: 
   - Added menu items for single and batch correction
   - Connected menu actions to appropriate dialogs
   - Implemented selection handling for both single and multiple cells

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Implemented cell highlighting based on correction status
   - Added tooltips to provide detailed information about corrections
   - Connected correction events to UI updates

3. **Controller Enhancements**:
   - Added methods to CorrectionController for data view integration
   - Implemented proper signal handling for correction events
   - Created interfaces for batch correction operations

4. **UI Flow Implementation**:
   - Implemented seamless flow from cell selection to correction creation
   - Added visual indicators for correction status
   - Connected correction application to UI refresh

### Recent Changes

- Updated DataView with context menu integration for corrections
- Enhanced CorrectionController with cell status methods
- Implemented cell highlighting and tooltips in DataView
- Connected BatchCorrectionDialog with selected cells
- Updated progress.md with current implementation status

### Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Address potential performance issues with large datasets
   - Implement selective highlighting for better performance
   - Optimize correction status retrieval

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive integration tests
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Test edge cases and error handling

3. **UI Refinement**:
   - Improve tooltip formatting for better readability
   - Enhance visual feedback for correction operations
   - Add progress indication for batch operations

## Implementation Plan

The implementation is divided into phases:

### Phase 1: Core Data Model ✓
- Implement `CorrectionRule` and `CorrectionRuleManager`
- Create unit tests for model classes

### Phase 2: Services Layer ✓
- Implement `CorrectionService` with two-pass algorithm
- Add configuration integration
- Create unit tests for services

### Phase 3: Controller Layer ✓
- Implement `CorrectionController` and background worker
- Handle rule management operations
- Create unit tests for controller

### Phase 4: UI Components ✓
- Create `CorrectionView` and rule table ✓
- Implement edit rule dialog ✓
- Implement batch correction dialog ✓
- Add progress dialog for feedback ✓

### Phase 5: Data View Integration (In Progress)
- Add cell highlighting based on status ✓
- Implement context menu integration ✓
- Add tooltips for cell status ✓
- Complete end-to-end testing and refinement

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization (Next)
- Create integration tests
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Ensure proper encoding support

## Test Status

- 448 passing tests (up from 408)
- 49 failing tests (down from 89)

### Test Categories:
- UI Component Tests: Most passing after recent fixes ✓
- Controller Tests: Some failures requiring investigation
- Integration Tests: Several failures - to be addressed in Phase 5
- Model Tests: All passing ✓
- Service Tests: All passing ✓

## Known Issues

1. **BatchCorrectionDialog Service Integration**
   - CorrectionService needs to implement apply_correction_to_cell method

2. **Cell Highlighting Performance**
   - Large datasets may experience performance issues with cell highlighting
   - Need to implement optimization for selective highlighting

3. **Missing Main Window Access**
   - CorrectionRuleView to DataView integration relies on app.get_main_window() which may not be available
   - Need to implement proper view communication mechanism

4. **Tooltip Display**
   - Multi-line tooltips may not display correctly in some scenarios
   - Consider formatting improvements for tooltip clarity

## Ongoing Discussions

- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Best approach for view communication
- Error handling strategies for correction operations
- User experience refinement for batch operations
