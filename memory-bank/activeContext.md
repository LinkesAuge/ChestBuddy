### Validation Visualization System Fix

We've successfully fixed a critical issue with the validation visualization system in ChestBuddy. Despite the validation service correctly identifying invalid entries (with 12,694 issues found according to the validation tab), none of these were being visually highlighted in the data view.

#### Diagnostic Approach

1. **Systematic Debugging**:
   - Added comprehensive debug logging across multiple components
   - Traced the validation status from creation to display
   - Identified disconnects between validation service, data view, and validation delegate

2. **Key Issues Discovered**:
   - Validation service was creating a validation status DataFrame but not setting correct enum values
   - Data view was not properly processing the validation status values
   - Validation delegate had issues with status detection and visualization priorities

3. **Validation Status Flow Analysis**:
   - Traced how validation status enums are created in ValidationService
   - Tracked how they're passed through signals to the DataView
   - Examined how they're stored in the model and retrieved by the delegate

#### Implemented Solutions

1. **Validation Service Improvements**:
   - Fixed ValidationService._update_validation_status to properly set status enum values
   - Added detailed logging to track validation issue counts and types
   - Enhanced the detection of correctable entries

2. **Data View Enhancements**:
   - Updated DataView._highlight_invalid_rows to correctly process validation statuses
   - Improved storage of validation status values in the model (Qt.UserRole + 2)
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging status processing

3. **Delegate Visualization Fixes**:
   - Enhanced ValidationStatusDelegate.paint to better prioritize statuses:
     1. CORRECTABLE has highest priority
     2. INVALID has second priority
     3. Row status is considered last
   - Improved color coding for different statuses
   - Added detailed comments to clarify status handling

#### Results

The validation visualization system now correctly displays all three types of validation statuses:

- **Valid cells**: Light green background
- **Invalid cells**: Deep red background with black border
- **Correctable cells**: Orange background with darker orange border

This improvement ensures that users receive accurate visual feedback about validation issues, making it easier to identify and fix data problems.

#### Next Steps

1. Consider further visual enhancements to make status differences more apparent
2. Implement additional validation visualization options (e.g., icon-based indicators)
3. Add validation summary features to provide statistics on validation results
4. Enhance the integration between validation and correction systems

The validation visualization fix is a key step in our correction system improvements, as it enables users to easily identify which entries need correction and which have automatic corrections available.

   - Initialization and configuration
   - Controller connection and setup
   - View content updates and error handling
   - Status message display
   - Action button handling
   - Corrections application
   - History request handling
   - Error state management
   - UI component creation and management

3. **Testing Patterns Applied**:
   - Used MockSignal for safe signal connections without access violations
   - Applied proper patching of UI components and methods
   - Carefully mocked class methods to track calls and verify behavior
   - Tested both success and error scenarios

4. **Challenges Overcome**:
   - Fixed initialization issues related to BaseView attributes
   - Properly mocked signal connections to prevent access violations
   - Addressed issues with method patching for UI components
   - Ensured proper testing of signal emissions and handling

#### Next Steps

1. Consider expanding test coverage to additional edge cases
2. Apply similar patterns to other view components with low coverage
3. Continue refining the MockSignal pattern for UI testing
4. Document these approaches in the testing best practices

This work follows our successful ValidationTabView test improvements and continues our progress toward our goal of 95% test coverage across the application.

3. **Implemented Test Patterns**:
   - Used MockSignal class to avoid PySide6 Signal connection issues
   - Applied proper patching techniques for UI components
   - Improved test fixtures to better represent real-world usage
   - Used assert_any_call to handle multiple status bar updates

4. **Challenges Overcome**:
   - Fixed issues with PySide6 signal handling in tests
   - Addressed UI component testing challenges by using real QWidgets where necessary
   - Implemented proper exception testing for components that catch exceptions internally
   - Created more robust tests that don't break from implementation changes

#### Next Steps

1. Apply similar test improvement patterns to other view components
2. Update documentation on best practices for Qt UI testing
3. Consider adding more integration tests between ValidationTabView and other components
4. Implement better test organization for future UI component tests

This work brings us closer to our goal of 95% test coverage for all components in the application.

### Recent Codebase Cleanup
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/correction_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/chart_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/views/correction_view_adapter.py`, marking these components as legacy
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/views/chart_view_adapter.py`, noting that it will be replaced by a future ChartView component
- Implemented new `ChartView` component to replace `ChartViewAdapter` and `ChartTab`, following the same pattern as `CorrectionView`
- Removed `chestbuddy/core/service_locator.py` and consolidated to `chestbuddy/utils/service_locator.py`
- Deleted `chestbuddy/ui/validation_tab.py` as it's been fully replaced by ValidationTabView
- Documented migration status of UI components in `codebase_cleanup.md`
- Updated `tests/test_main_window.py` to work with the new MainWindow constructor, fixing test failures
- Created comprehensive tests for `ChartView` in `tests/unit/ui/views/test_chart_view.py`

### Key Tasks in Progress
1. Modernizing the UI architecture from tab-based to view-based design
2. ✅ Updated MainWindow to use ChartView directly instead of ChartViewAdapter
3. ✅ Created tests for the new ChartView component
4. ✅ Improved test coverage for ValidationTabView from 29% to 80%
5. Update remaining tests to use the new view-based components directly

## Recent Codebase Cleanup

We have performed a cleanup of redundant code in the ChestBuddy application:

1. **Removed redundant service_locator.py** from the core directory, as it duplicated functionality in utils/service_locator.py
2. **Added deprecation warnings** to legacy UI components that are being phased out:
   - correction_tab.py
   - chart_tab.py
   - correction_view_adapter.py (identified that MainWindow already uses CorrectionView directly)
   - chart_view_adapter.py (identified that it will need a ChartView replacement)
3. **Deleted legacy UI component** no longer in use:
   - validation_tab.py (replaced by ValidationTabView)
   - Updated test_ui_components.py to use ValidationTabView
4. **Implemented new modern components**:
   - Created ChartView to replace ChartViewAdapter and ChartTab
   - Maintained API compatibility for smooth transition
5. **Marked signal_tracer.py** as a debug-only utility
6. **Created documentation** for future cleanup tasks in memory-bank/codebase_cleanup.md
7. **Documented migration status** of UI components in codebase_cleanup.md
8. **Created tests** for the new ChartView component in tests/unit/ui/views/test_chart_view.py

These changes are part of our ongoing effort to modernize the codebase by moving from the tab-based UI to a view-based architecture. The next step is to update remaining tests to use the new view components, followed by the removal of the deprecated adapter and legacy tab components.

- ✅ Simplified CorrectionRule data structure by removing redundant 'order' and 'description' fields

### Missing Features

- 🔄 Context menu for data cells with options for individual and batch correction
- 🔄 Enhanced Import/Export dialog with file format selection and preview
- 🔄 Improved batch correction dialog with better pattern recognition
- 🔄 Settings panel with configuration options

### Current Tasks

1. Implement context menu for DataView cells with the following options:
   - Apply correction rules to selected cells
   - Apply specific rule to selected cells
   - Batch correction for similar values
   - View validation details

2. Enhance Import/Export dialog with:
   - File format selection (CSV, Excel, JSON)
   - Preview of rules before importing
   - Options for handling duplicates
   - Filtering options for export

3. Improve batch correction dialog:
   - Better pattern recognition for similar errors
   - Preview of validation results
   - Auto-correction suggestions
   - Optimization for multiple cell selection

4. Add settings panel with configuration checkboxes for:
   - Auto-correction preferences
   - Validation options
   - Display settings

### Next Steps

1. Implement context menu for rule table with quick actions
2. Connect settings to ConfigManager for persistence
3. Enhance filter controls with additional options
4. Create unit tests for new UI components

### Key Decisions

1. Replaced MainWindow status bar with dedicated QStatusBar in CorrectionView
2. Implementation of file dialog integration for rule import/export
3. Use of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for remaining features
4. Follow UI component style guidelines from mockup
5. Prioritize user experience with responsive feedback
6. Simplified CorrectionRule data structure by removing 'order' field and implementing implicit ordering
7. Further simplified CorrectionRule by removing unused 'description' field
8. Added robust error handling for all rule operations

## Recent Model Changes

We've made important simplifications to the correction rule data model:

1. **Removed Order Field**: The 'order' field has been removed from CorrectionRule. Rules are now ordered implicitly by their position in the list, making the code more intuitive and removing redundancy.

2. **Removed Description Field**: The 'description' field has been removed as it was unused and added unnecessary complexity to the data structure.

3. **Fixed Deletion Issues**: Implemented a more robust approach to rule deletion that prevents multiple rules from being deleted accidentally.

These changes have significantly simplified the data structure and made the correction feature more maintainable.

## DataView Integration

The integration between the DataView and correction components is a critical part of the implementation, focusing on user experience and visual feedback.

### Current Integration Work

1. Context Menu Integration
   - Adding context menu for cells to perform corrections
   - Connecting menu actions to the controller
   - Handling selection states for contextual options

2. Visual Feedback
   - Cell highlighting based on correction status
