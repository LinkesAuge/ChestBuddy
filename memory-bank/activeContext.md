## Known Issues

- No known issues at this time

### Column Name Standardization

We've updated the `ChestDataModel.EXPECTED_COLUMNS` to match the actual column names in our standard CSV file (`Chests_input_test.csv`). The columns are now defined using uppercase names:

```python
EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]
```

Previously, we were using title case column names like "Player Name", but our CSV files actually use uppercase names like "PLAYER". This mismatch was causing data to not display properly in the table view.

We've also updated the `DataManager._map_columns` method to include a default mapping between old column names and new ones to maintain compatibility with existing code that might be using the old column names.

Tests have been updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that all references to column names use the new uppercase format.

### CSV Operations Refactoring 

### Multi-Cell Paste Enhancement

We've improved the user experience by implementing multi-cell paste functionality, allowing users to select multiple cells in the table and paste content to all of them simultaneously. The key improvements include:

1. Modified the `_paste_cell` method in `DataView` to handle multiple selections
2. Added a context menu option that shows "Paste to all X selected cells" when multiple cells are selected
3. Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+V) for paste operations
4. Added better logging for paste operations to improve debugging

This enhancement allows for more efficient data entry and editing, especially when the same value needs to be applied to multiple cells. Users can now:

1. Select multiple cells by clicking and dragging or using Ctrl+click for non-adjacent selections
2. Press Ctrl+V or use the right-click context menu to paste to all selected cells
3. See immediate feedback as all selected cells are updated simultaneously

### Progress Dialog Improvements

We're enhancing the progress dialog to provide a better user experience during multi-file operations. The following improvements will be implemented:

1. **Single Dialog for Multiple Files**
   - Keep one progress modal active for all files instead of creating a new one for each file
   - Maintain continuity in the UI during the entire loading process
   - Eliminate flickering and dialog recreation between files

2. **Aggregated Progress Tracking**
   - Display running total of processed rows across all files
   - Avoid resetting row counter between files
   - Show total progress as "Total: X of Y rows processed"

3. **Clear File Progress Indicators**
   - Show "Reading file X of Y" to indicate overall file progress
   - Display current filename being processed
   - Track and show overall completion percentage

4. **Enhanced User Control**
   - Make the progress dialog moveable while active
   - Allow users to position the dialog where preferred
   - Keep the dialog on top but not fixed in position

5. **Success Indication**
   - Change the button to green when files have been loaded successfully
   - Provide clear visual feedback about operation success
   - Use ProgressBar's existing SUCCESS state for consistent styling

These improvements will make the file loading process more transparent and provide better feedback to users, especially when dealing with multiple or large files.

Implementation will focus on:
- Updating MainWindow._on_load_started() to prevent creating new dialogs unnecessarily
- Ensuring proper state tracking in _loading_state across all files
- Removing the FramelessWindowHint flag from ProgressDialog to allow movement
- Applying the SUCCESS state to the progress bar on successful completion
- Styling the button appropriately in the success state

## Current Focus: CSV Loading Improvements

We are implementing enhancements to the CSV file loading process to improve performance and user experience with large files. The current implementation causes the application to freeze during loading with no visual feedback.

### Implementation Plan for CSV Loading Improvements

1. **Create MultiCSVLoadTask Class**
   - Create a new class extending BackgroundTask
   - Handle loading multiple files with progress reporting
   - Use chunked reading for better memory efficiency

2. **Update DataManager**
   - Add new signals:
     - `load_progress(str, int, int)` for file name, current progress, total
     - `load_started()` and `load_finished()` for UI feedback
   - Modify `load_csv` to use the new task
   - Implement cancellation support

3. **Add Progress Dialog in MainWindow**
   - Create QProgressDialog when loading starts
   - Update the dialog as loading progresses
   - Support cancellation with proper cleanup
   - Close dialog when loading completes

4. **Use Efficient File Processing**
   - Switch from `read_csv` to `read_csv_chunked` or `read_csv_background`
   - Process files in manageable chunks
   - Report progress based on chunks processed

5. **Implement Proper Cancellation**
   - Allow users to cancel long-running operations
   - Clean up resources when canceled
   - Update UI appropriately after cancellation

### Expected Benefits
- UI remains responsive during file loading
- Users see visual progress indication
- Users can cancel operations if needed
- Better memory management with chunked reading
- Improved performance for large files

### Current Tasks
- [ ] Create MultiCSVLoadTask class
- [ ] Update DataManager with new signals and methods
- [ ] Add progress dialog to MainWindow
- [ ] Implement proper chunked file loading
- [ ] Add cancellation support
- [ ] Create tests for new functionality

These mockups illustrate the key UI enhancements, including:
1. Clear visual indication when views are disabled (⊗ symbol) when no data is loaded
2. Prominent call-to-action on the dashboard when empty
3. Compact header design in the Data view to maximize table space
4. Streamlined filtering and status display
5. Logical grouping of action buttons
