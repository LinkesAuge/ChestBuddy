# Current Focus

The active development focus is UI enhancement with a particular emphasis on dashboard components and user experience improvements. Our current initiatives include:

## UI Enhancement Phases

1. **Building Reusable Components**: Creating a library of consistent, styled UI components that can be reused across the application.
2. **Enhancing Navigation**: Improving the sidebar navigation and ensuring consistent data state awareness across all views.
3. **Redesigning Dashboard**: Implementing a modern, card-based dashboard with actionable insights and quick access to key functions.
4. **Optimizing Data Views**: Improving table views, charts, and visualizations for better information presentation.
5. **Improving User Feedback**: Enhancing progress indication, error reporting, and status messaging throughout the application.

## Recent Decisions

### UI Framework Decisions
- Using PySide6 for all UI components for modern styling capabilities
- Implementing a component-based architecture for better reusability
- Adopting signals/slots pattern for loose coupling between components
- Following a card-based UI pattern for dashboard elements
- Using CSS-based styling for consistent theming

### Implementation Strategy
- Creating adapter classes to connect views with data models
- Using factory methods for UI component creation
- Implementing responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Centralizing style definitions for consistency
- Using a state management pattern for complex UI states

## Recent Improvements

### Dashboard Components
1. **StatCard**: Displays key metrics with title, value, trend, and comparison
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested
   - Features: Animation, conditional styling, interactive tooltips

2. **ChartPreview**: Thumbnail view of available charts
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested
   - Features: Click-to-expand, dynamic updating, hover effects

3. **RecentFilesList**: Shows recently opened files
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested
   - Features: Quick access links, file metadata, selection events

4. **WelcomeStateWidget**: First-use experience panel
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested
   - Features: Quick start actions, tutorial links
   - Updates: Renamed "Get Started" button to "Import Data" for clarity
   - Fixed: Action signal now correctly emits "import" instead of "import_csv"

5. **ActionCard**: Card-based UI for common actions
   - Status: ✅ Implemented and tested
   - Features: Icon, title, description, hover effects
   - Improvement: Layout spacing and hover animations enhanced

6. **ProgressDialog**: Modal dialog showing import/processing progress
   - Status: ✅ Fixed visibility issues during import operations
   - Features: Cancel option, progress percentage, operation description
   - Improvement: Now properly shown during CSV import operations

### Fixed UI Issues
1. **Dashboard Layout**:
   - ✅ Removed redundant empty state panel at bottom that was overlaying other elements
   - ✅ Improved spacing and proportions between dashboard sections
   - ✅ Enhanced visual hierarchy of dashboard components

2. **Import Operation Feedback**:
   - ✅ Fixed progress dialog visibility during file imports
   - ✅ Added proper progress indication with cancel button
   - ✅ Enhanced error reporting during import failures

3. **UI State Management**:
   - ✅ Fixed UI elements remaining blocked after data loading
   - ✅ Improved enable/disable logic for data-dependent actions
   - ✅ Enhanced status bar updates with current data state
   - ✅ Better synchronization between data model state and UI components

### CSV Loading Improvements
- Chunk-based processing for memory efficiency
- Progress reporting during load operations
- Automatic encoding detection
- Multi-file batch processing capabilities
- Proper threading to prevent UI freezing

### Report Generation System
- PDF export framework with templating
- Chart inclusion in reports
- Data tables with styling options
- Configurable report templates

## Known Issues

### UI Interaction Issues
- ⚠️ Status: Partially Resolved
- Description: Progress dialog wasn't appearing during file imports and UI remained blocked after loading completed
- Root cause: Improper handling of progress dialog creation and UI updates after data loading
- Fix: Updated MainWindow methods to properly show progress dialog and unblock UI elements after loading
- Validation: Progress dialog now appears during imports and UI elements are properly enabled after loading

### Performance Issues
- ⚠️ Status: Investigating
- Description: UI becomes unresponsive during heavy data operations
- Root cause: Blocking operations in UI thread and suboptimal threading model
- Planned fix: Implement better threading model and background processing

### Chart Export Quality
- ⚠️ Status: Investigating
- Description: Charts lose quality when exported to PDF
- Root cause: Vector rendering issues in chart export
- Planned fix: Implement proper vector-based chart export

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. Complete the remaining dashboard components
2. Fix any remaining UI interaction issues
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback
4. Implement quick filter functionality on dashboard
5. Optimize performance for large datasets

### Mid-term Goals
1. Complete the advanced analysis module
2. Enhance reporting capabilities
3. Implement data comparison features
4. Add batch processing functionality

### Long-term Vision
1. Machine learning integration for predictive analysis
2. Cloud synchronization capabilities
3. Mobile companion application
4. Real-time collaboration features

## Technical Considerations

### Current Technical Challenges
1. Managing memory usage with large datasets
2. Maintaining UI responsiveness during complex operations
3. Balancing feature richness with application performance
4. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility

### Architecture Decisions
1. Model-View-Presenter pattern with adapters
2. Signal-based communication between components
3. Factory methods for UI component creation
4. State management pattern for UI states
5. Service locator for application services
