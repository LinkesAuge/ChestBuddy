# Active Development Context

## Active Context - May 16, 2024

### Recent Codebase Cleanup
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/correction_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/chart_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/views/correction_view_adapter.py`, marking these components as legacy
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/views/chart_view_adapter.py`, noting that it will be replaced by a future ChartView component
- Implemented new `ChartView` component to replace `ChartViewAdapter` and `ChartTab`, following the same pattern as `CorrectionView`
- Removed `chestbuddy/core/service_locator.py` and consolidated to `chestbuddy/utils/service_locator.py`
- Deleted `chestbuddy/ui/validation_tab.py` as it's been fully replaced by ValidationTabView
- Documented migration status of UI components in `codebase_cleanup.md`
- Updated `tests/test_main_window.py` to work with the new MainWindow constructor, fixing test failures
- Created comprehensive tests for `ChartView` in `tests/unit/ui/views/test_chart_view.py`

### Key Tasks in Progress
1. Modernizing the UI architecture from tab-based to view-based design
2. ✅ Updated MainWindow to use ChartView directly instead of ChartViewAdapter
3. ✅ Created tests for the new ChartView component
4. Update remaining tests to use the new view-based components directly

## Recent Codebase Cleanup

We have performed a cleanup of redundant code in the ChestBuddy application:

1. **Removed redundant service_locator.py** from the core directory, as it duplicated functionality in utils/service_locator.py
2. **Added deprecation warnings** to legacy UI components that are being phased out:
   - correction_tab.py
   - chart_tab.py
   - correction_view_adapter.py (identified that MainWindow already uses CorrectionView directly)
   - chart_view_adapter.py (identified that it will need a ChartView replacement)
3. **Deleted legacy UI component** no longer in use:
   - validation_tab.py (replaced by ValidationTabView)
   - Updated test_ui_components.py to use ValidationTabView
4. **Implemented new modern components**:
   - Created ChartView to replace ChartViewAdapter and ChartTab
   - Maintained API compatibility for smooth transition
5. **Marked signal_tracer.py** as a debug-only utility
6. **Created documentation** for future cleanup tasks in memory-bank/codebase_cleanup.md
7. **Documented migration status** of UI components in codebase_cleanup.md
8. **Created tests** for the new ChartView component in tests/unit/ui/views/test_chart_view.py

These changes are part of our ongoing effort to modernize the codebase by moving from the tab-based UI to a view-based architecture. The next step is to update remaining tests to use the new view components, followed by the removal of the deprecated adapter and legacy tab components.

## Technical Decisions

### View-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Replace tab-based interface with dedicated view components.

**Rationale**:
- Improved separation of concerns
- Better testability of individual components
- More modern UI approach
- Easier to add new views or rearrange existing ones

**Implementation**:
- Each view is a self-contained QWidget subclass
- MainWindow manages view switching and coordination
- Views communicate through signals/slots and view controllers
- Common functionality extracted to base classes or utility functions

### Signal/Slot Architecture

We're reinforcing our commitment to a signal/slot architecture for component communication:

1. **View Components**:
   - Emit signals when user actions occur
   - Provide slots for external actions to affect the view
   - Do not directly call methods on other components

2. **Controllers**:
   - Connect signals from views to appropriate handlers
   - Coordinate between models and views
   - Manage application state

3. **Services**:
   - Provide business logic implementation
   - Emit signals when state changes
   - Accept calls from controllers to perform operations

### Testing Strategy

We're updating our testing approach to match the new architecture:

1. **Component Tests**:
   - Test each view component in isolation
   - Mock dependencies (models, services)
   - Verify signals are emitted correctly
   - Verify UI updates in response to external signals

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify correct signal propagation
   - Test data flow through the system

3. **Signal Testing**:
   - Use qtbot.waitSignal for asynchronous operations
   - Test signal emissions with correct parameters
   - Test signal chains (when one signal triggers another)
   
4. **Controller-Based Testing**:
   - Test through controller interfaces rather than direct UI inspection
   - Verify controller methods are called with correct parameters
   - Focus on behavior rather than implementation details

## PySide6 Installation Update and Test Fixes

### PySide6 Compatibility

We encountered issues with the latest version of PySide6 (6.8.3) when trying to run tests with coverage. The issue manifested as an import error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'QObject' from 'PySide6.QtCore'
```

We resolved this by downgrading to PySide6 version 6.6.0, which proved to be more compatible with our current test setup. The tests now run successfully with this version.

### ValidationTabView Test Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the `test_validation_tab_view.py` tests:

1. Added a `MockSignal` class to properly simulate Qt signals without relying on real QObject signal connections
2. Updated the mock fixtures to avoid creating real UI components during testing
3. Fixed the validation service mock to include all needed methods and properties
4. Modified the test methods to directly test the targeted functionality rather than going through UI interactions

These changes have resulted in a more robust test suite that's less prone to issues with Qt's signal/slot mechanism during testing. All tests now pass successfully.

The current test coverage for `validation_tab_view.py` is approximately 29%, with most of the missing coverage in UI setup and initialization code. Future test improvements could focus on increasing this coverage.

## ValidationTabView Test Coverage Improvements

We have significantly improved the test coverage for the ValidationTabView component in the ChestBuddy application. The coverage has increased from 29% to 67%, which is a substantial improvement.

### Test Additions

We added the following new tests to improve coverage:

1. **UI Setup Tests**:
   - `test_real_ui_setup`: Tests the actual UI component creation with minimal patching
   - `test_validation_list_section_creation`: Tests the validation list section creation
   - `test_actual_create_validation_list_section`: Tests the implementation details of validation list sections

2. **Signal Connection Tests**:
   - Enhanced the signal connection tests to properly handle Qt signals
   - Added a custom `MockSignal` implementation to simulate Qt signals without causing access violations

3. **Event Handler Tests**:
   - `test_on_validation_changed`: Tests response to validation changes
   - `test_update_validation_preference`: Tests preference updates
   - `test_on_list_add_clicked_with_dialog_interaction`: Tests dialog interactions
   - `test_on_list_add_clicked_dialog_cancelled`: Tests dialog cancellation

4. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - `test_display_service_error`: Tests error display for service errors
   - `test_display_error`: Tests general error display functionality

### Challenges

We encountered several challenges with the Qt signal/slot testing, particularly with:

1. Signal spying in PySide6
2. Mocking QMessageBox dialogs
3. PySide6 compatibility with test coverage tools

### Solutions

We implemented several solutions to overcome these challenges:

1. Created a custom `MockSignal` class to avoid real QObject signal issues
2. Used method replacement instead of direct patching for some tests
3. Improved test patterns for signal connections
4. Downgraded PySide6 to version 6.6.0 for better compatibility with tests

### Next Steps

To further improve test coverage, we should consider:

1. Adding tests for the remaining uncovered code sections (73-75, 452-564, 595-602, 615-619)
2. Enhancing tests for dialog interactions
3. Implementing more real-world scenario tests
4. Testing validation list operations more comprehensively

The test improvements provide a solid foundation for future UI components testing and align with our goal of maintaining high code quality and test coverage throughout the codebase.
