### Application Architecture

The application architecture follows a clean controller-based organization:

1. **Core Layer**:
   - Models: ChestDataModel, ValidationModel
   - Services: CSVService, ValidationService, CorrectionService, ChartService
   - Controllers: FileOperationsController, ProgressController, ErrorHandlingController, ViewStateController, DataViewController, UIStateController

2. **UI Layer**:
   - MainWindow: Main application window (delegates to controllers)
   - Views: Dashboard, Data, Validation, Correction, Charts
   - Components: IUpdatable components, UpdatableComponent base class
   - Utils: UpdateManager for managing UI component updates

3. **Utils Layer**:
   - Configuration
   - Logging
   - File operations helpers
   - **SignalManager**: Utility for signal connection management
   - **Signal Standards**: Reference for signal naming and connection patterns
   - **ServiceLocator**: Utility for accessing application-wide services

### Current UI Navigation

The navigation system uses a sidebar that provides access to:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of data and recent files
2. **Data**: Tabular view of imported data
3. **Validation**: View and resolve validation issues
4. **Correction**: Apply automated corrections to data
5. **Charts**: Visualize data in various chart formats

### Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets (>100,000 rows) can consume significant memory
2. **UI Performance**: While signal throttling has improved the situation, updates to the UI thread can still cause momentary freezing with very large datasets
3. **Thread Cleanup**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown (non-critical)
4. **Controller Tests**: Some controller tests that require QApplication need to be updated to use pytest-qt
5. **QTimer Cleanup**: UpdateManager's `__del__` method needs to handle cases where timers are already deleted (fixed)

### Column Name Standardization

The application supports diverse CSV file formats through:

- Column name mapping to standardize input data (using `EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]`)
- Case-insensitive comparison for column identification
- Regular expression patterns for fuzzy matching similar columns
- Default column templates for easy mapping

## Implementation Details

### UI Update Interface
We're implementing a standardized approach to UI updates through:
- **IUpdatable** protocol: Defines a common interface for all updatable components
- **UpdateManager** utility: Manages component dependencies and debounces updates
- **UpdatableComponent** base class: Provides common implementation for UI components

### Recent Progress
- Fixed MockUpdatable in tests to properly implement the IUpdatable protocol
- Created QWidget-based MockUpdatableWidget for integration with QWidget-based components
- Adjusted test cases to properly verify UpdateManager functionality
- Modified test assertions to correctly test the actual implementation behavior

### Current Issues
- The UpdateManager's handling of pending updates needed adjustment in tests
- The MockUpdatable class required QWidget implementation for complete testing
- Test assertions needed to be fixed to match the actual implementation

## Signal Management Enhancements
The SignalManager utility provides:
- Centralized signal connection tracking
- Prioritized connections for controlling execution order
- Connection type safety with parameter counting
- Throttled connections (both throttle and debounce modes)
- Debugging tools for connection inspection

### Signal Standards
We've established these guidelines:
- **Naming**: Consistent naming pattern (sender_action_target)
- **Connection**: Centralized connection management through SignalManager
- **Validation**: Type compatibility checking for all connections
- **Prioritization**: Execution order control for critical operations
- **Throttling**: Performance optimization for frequent UI updates

## Project Insights

The standardized update interface represents a significant improvement in:
1. **Consistency**: All UI components will follow the same update pattern
2. **Performance**: Debounced updates prevent UI freezing during rapid data changes
3. **Testability**: Standardized interface makes component testing easier
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code with clear update responsibility
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new updatable components

The current phase builds on the signal management improvements, focusing specifically on standardizing how UI components receive and process update requests.
