- **Data View priority**: Data view will be updated to match the new UI patterns established in the dashboard
- **Empty state handling**: All views requiring data will use the EmptyStateWidget for a consistent UX
- **Component reusability**: Prioritized creating a library of flexible UI components that can be used throughout the application
- **Memory management**: Optimized memory usage during data loading by implementing progressive loading and processing

## Dashboard Redesign Progress

### Completed Components:

1. **StatCard**: A card component for displaying data metrics with visual indicators
   - Features:
     - Icon support for visual context
     - Trend indicators (up/down arrows with custom colors)
     - Click actions for navigation
     - Color customization based on value
     - Compact and expanded modes
     - Subtitle/trend text display
   - Located at: `chestbuddy/ui/widgets/stat_card.py`
   - Tests: All 12 tests passing

2. **ChartPreview**: A component for displaying interactive chart previews
   - Features:
     - Title and subtitle display
     - Icon support for visual context
     - Clickable interaction for detailed view
     - Compact mode for space-efficient display
     - Stacked layout with placeholder when no chart is available
     - Supports setting and clearing charts dynamically
   - Located at: `chestbuddy/ui/widgets/chart_preview.py`
   - Tests: All 10 tests passing

### In Progress:
- **ActionCard**: Developing a component to group related actions with context
- **RecentFilesList**: Enhancing the file list component with metadata and actions
- **WelcomeStateWidget**: Extending the EmptyStateWidget for welcome experience

## Recent Decisions

1. **Dashboard Component Design**: We've decided to create standalone, reusable dashboard components that can be composed in different arrangements, making the dashboard more flexible and maintainable.

2. **Trend Indicators**: For the StatCard component, we're using colored up/down arrows for trend visualization, with green for positive trends and red for negative trends.

3. **Dashboard States**: We're implementing multiple states for the dashboard:
   - Empty state (no data)
   - Welcome state (first-time users)
   - Data loaded state
   - Error state

4. **Chart Integration**: The ChartPreview component will leverage the existing chart functionality but provide a more compact and interactive preview.

5. **Dashboard Architecture**: We're following a modular approach with a DashboardService providing data to the components via the DashboardViewAdapter.

## Implementation Strategy

We are taking a phased approach to implementing the Dashboard Redesign:

### Phase 3a: Dashboard Components
1. ✅ Create StatCard component for displaying metrics with visual indicators
2. ✅ Create ChartPreview component with Qt Charts integration
3. 🚧 Implement ActionCard for grouped actions
4. 🚧 Enhance RecentFilesList with metadata and actions
5. 🚧 Create WelcomeStateWidget for first-time user experience

### Phase 3b: Dashboard Service
1. 🚧 Create DashboardDataService for statistics and chart data
2. 🚧 Implement data change monitoring
3. 🚧 Add frequently used actions tracking
4. 🚧 Create dashboard configuration management

### Phase 3c: Dashboard View Integration
1. 🚧 Refactor DashboardView to use new components
2. 🚧 Implement state transitions
3. 🚧 Create DashboardViewAdapter
4. 🚧 Update MainWindow integration

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Dashboard Components Implementation**:
   - Implement ActionCard component
   - Enhance RecentFilesList
   - Develop WelcomeStateWidget

2. **Begin Dashboard Service Implementation**:
   - Create service for statistics and chart data
   - Implement data change monitoring

3. **Plan Dashboard View Refactoring**:
   - Design component layout and state transitions
   - Plan integration with existing navigation system

## Technical Considerations

1. **Trend Calculation**: Need to track historical values to calculate trends for StatCard components.

2. **Chart Rendering**: The ChartPreview component will need to handle efficient rendering of matplotlib charts within the Qt framework.

3. **Performance**: Dashboard needs to remain responsive even with multiple components and real-time updates.

4. **Widget Communication**: Components need to communicate with each other and the main application through a well-defined signal/slot mechanism.

5. **Test Mocking**: For testing the dashboard components, we'll need to mock the data service and chart generation.

## Recent Component Implementation Details

## Report Generation System

We are planning a report generation system that will allow users to create custom reports from their chest data. This system will:

1. **Define Report Templates**: Create predefined templates for common reports
2. **Support Custom Reports**: Allow users to define custom report layouts
3. **Export Options**: Provide multiple export formats (PDF, HTML, CSV)
4. **Visualization Integration**: Include charts and graphs in reports
5. **Scheduling**: Allow automated report generation on a schedule

This feature will be implemented after completing the current UI enhancement phases.

### Recent Decisions

1. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Import/Export are actions, not views - moved to toolbar
   - Data, Analysis, and Reports views require data to be loaded
   - Dashboard, Settings, and Help always accessible

2. **Data View Priority**:
   - Data view is the primary interaction point after data loading
   - Empty states should provide clear path to data loading

3. **Empty State Handling**:
   - Each view has customized empty state messaging and icons
   - Action buttons in empty states trigger data import
   - BaseView now manages empty state display logic

4. **Component Reusability**:
   - Created a more extendable BaseView with QStackedWidget for content/empty states
   - Used EmptyStateWidget consistently across all data-dependent views
   - Standardized action button styling and behavior

5. **Memory Management**:
   - Improved object ownership for more reliable cleanup
   - Fixed potential memory leaks in background workers
