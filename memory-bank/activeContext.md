- Corrected progress reporting inconsistencies
- Implemented proper state tracking
- **Designing comprehensive solution for persistent UI blocking issues during operations**

### Data Display Problems
- Fixed table sorting issues
- Corrected column alignment problems
- Addressed data rendering performance issues
- Fixed filtering inconsistencies

### UI Blocking
- Addressed issues with UI becoming unresponsive during data operations
- Fixed blocking dialog problems during first import
- Implemented multiple delayed UI checks to catch the end of background operations
- **Developing a comprehensive UI State Management System to systematically solve UI blocking issues**

## Recent Improvements

### Dashboard Components
- Implemented `StatCard` component for key metrics
- Created `ChartPreview` for data visualization
- Added `ActionButton` component for common actions
- Implemented responsive grid layout
- Created `ProgressDialog` component
- **Implementing UI State Management System for centralized UI state control**

### UI State Management System
- Designed a centralized approach to manage UI blocking/unblocking
- Implemented reference counting for blocking operations
- Created context managers for automatic UI state handling
- Developed a mixin for blockable UI elements
- Added support for element groups for batch operations
- **Building a robust, thread-safe system that replaces timing-dependent solutions**

## Known Issues

### UI Interaction
- Menu items sometimes remain disabled after operation completion
- Occasional freezing during large data imports
- Table view remains blocked after first import in some cases
- Dialog closure doesn't always unblock UI elements
- **Current ad-hoc approach to UI blocking/unblocking is fragile and timing-dependent**

### Performance
- Slowdown when handling large datasets
- Validation process creates UI lag
- Memory usage increases significantly with large files
- Ongoing investigation into UI responsiveness during heavy data operations

## Next Steps

### Short-term
- Complete dashboard components
- Optimize data loading process
- Add more validation rules
- Implement user preferences system
- **Integrate new UI State Management System with MainWindow, ProgressDialog, and DataView**

### Mid-term
- Improve reporting capabilities
- Add export format options
- Implement advanced filtering
- Create saved searches functionality
- **Extend UI State Management to cover all UI elements and operations**

### Long-term
- Add collaborative features
- Implement cloud synchronization
- Create template system for common data patterns
- Develop plug-in architecture
- **Build a comprehensive monitoring system for UI performance and responsiveness**

## Technical Considerations

### Current Technical Challenges
1. Managing memory usage with large datasets
2. Maintaining UI responsiveness during complex operations
3. Balancing feature richness with application performance
4. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility

### Architecture Decisions
1. Model-View-Presenter pattern with adapters
2. Signal-based communication between components
3. Factory methods for UI component creation
4. State management pattern for UI states
5. Service locator for application services

## Active Branches
- `feature/dashboard-ui`: Dashboard UI improvements and components
- `feature/chart-enhancements`: Chart visualization improvements
- `bugfix/progress-dialog`: Fixes for progress dialog visibility and UI blocking issues
- `master`: Main development branch

## Team Focus
- UI Development: Enhancing user experience and interface components
- Data Processing: Optimizing data handling and analysis algorithms
- Quality Assurance: Ensuring robust error handling and stability

### Major Bugfixes
We've addressed several critical bugs in the import functionality:

1. **Fixed double data processing** - Data was being processed twice during import, causing UI lag and duplicate operations. Fixed by removing redundant signal emission in the DataManager.

2. **UI unblocking issues** - Improved the MainWindow._on_load_finished method to ensure the UI is properly unblocked after loading data, especially when using the menu bar's "Open" option.

3. **Import action consistency** - Standardized all import actions throughout the application to ensure they all emit consistent "import" signals. This includes:
   - Dashboard action cards now map "import_csv" to "import"
   - All empty state widgets use the same signal pattern
   - Menu actions connect properly to the standard import handler

4. **Logger integration** - Added proper logging to the dashboard adapter to provide better debugging information.

5. **Progress dialog confirmation UI blocking** - Fixed issue where the UI would remain blocked after clicking "Confirm" on the import progress dialog (only on first import). Improved the fix by properly sequencing event processing and dialog reference cleanup to ensure the dialog's events are fully processed before removing the reference.

## Current Development Focus

### UI State Management System Redesign

After multiple attempts to fix the persistent UI blocking issue after the first import, we've decided to implement a comprehensive, architectural solution rather than continuing with reactive fixes:

1. **Comprehensive UI State Manager**
   - Designing a centralized `UIStateManager` singleton to track and control UI state
   - Implementing reference counting for blocking operations
   - Creating a context-manager based approach for UI blocking operations
   - Adding registration system for UI elements with custom handlers

2. **Key Components of New Design**
   - `UIStateManager`: Central singleton for tracking UI state
   - `OperationContext`: Context manager for UI blocking operations
   - `UIElementGroups`: Standard groups of UI elements 
   - `UIOperations`: Standard operations that can block UI elements
   - Custom handlers for special UI components like DataView

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Phase 1: Core implementation (UIStateManager, signals, context)
   - Phase 2: MainWindow integration
   - Phase 3: Progress dialog integration
   - Phase 4: DataView integration 
   - Phase 5: BackgroundWorker integration
   - Phase 6: Comprehensive testing
   - Phase 7: Documentation and finalization

4. **Advantages Over Previous Approaches**
   - Centralized control of UI state
   - Proper reference counting for multiple blocking operations
   - No reliance on timing or delayed checks
   - Thread-safe implementation
   - Declarative rather than imperative approach
   - Clear visibility into what's blocking UI elements and why

This architectural approach should resolve the UI blocking issues permanently by replacing our current ad-hoc implementation with a robust system that properly tracks UI state transitions.

### Current Hypotheses

Based on investigation so far, we have several hypotheses:

1. **Table Enabling Timing**: The DataView's table may be disabled during data population but not properly re-enabled during the first import.
2. **Event Processing**: There may be pending events that aren't properly processed during the first import sequence.
3. **Modal Dialog Issues**: The progress dialog's modality may be affecting the UI differently on first vs. subsequent imports.
4. **View Transition Race Condition**: The transition to the Data view may be occurring before the UI is fully ready during the first import.

Our enhanced logging should help identify which of these is the root cause.
