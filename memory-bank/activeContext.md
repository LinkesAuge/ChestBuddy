# Active Context

*Last Updated: 2023-10-21*

## Current Focus: UI Enhancement - Dashboard Components Implementation

We're currently implementing new dashboard components to create a modern, card-based UI for the dashboard view. The focus is on:

1. Creating reusable card components for the dashboard:
   - `ActionCard`: Interactive cards for dashboard actions
   - `ChartCard`: Cards for displaying chart thumbnails

2. Implementing the new `DashboardViewAdapter` with a card-based layout structure featuring:
   - Quick Actions section with ActionCards
   - Recent Files section with file cards 
   - Charts & Analytics section with ChartCards
   - Empty state handling for each section

## Phases of UI Enhancement:

### Phase 1: Reusable Components âœ… Complete
**Status**: Complete with all tests passing
- Created `ActionButton`, `ActionToolbar`, `EmptyStateWidget`, and `FilterBar` components
- Implemented comprehensive test coverage for all components

### Phase 2: Navigation Enhancement âœ… Complete  
**Status**: Complete with navigation functioning properly
- Updated sidebar navigation with data-aware functionality
- Implemented data state management across view adapters
- Added empty state handling for all views
- Modified `MainWindow` to support the new navigation structure

### Phase 3: Dashboard Redesign ðŸš§ In Progress
**Status**: Component implementation nearly complete, integration is next focus
- Implemented and tested dashboard components:
  - `StatCard`: Displays metrics with title, value, trend, and subtitle
  - `ChartPreview`: Displays chart previews with title, subtitle, icon
  - `RecentFilesList`: Enhanced file list showing metadata with action buttons
  - `WelcomeStateWidget`: Multi-step welcome guide for first-time users
  - `ActionCard`: Interactive cards for grouped actions with title, description, and icon
- Created `DashboardService` for centralizing dashboard functionality:
  - Statistics calculation (total records, unique players, etc.)
  - Recent files listing and trend data
  - Chart preview generation
  - Action card management
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all implemented components

**Next Steps**:
- Complete DashboardViewAdapter integration with components
- Connect dashboard layout with DashboardService
- Update MainWindow integration with new dashboard
- Final testing and refinement

### Phase 4: Data View Optimization ðŸš§ Planned
**Status**: Planned
- Will improve table performance with large datasets
- Add column management tools
- Implement filtering and sorting controls

## Recent Decisions

1. **Component Architecture**: We're using a component-based architecture for UI elements, with reusable widgets that emit signals for communication.

2. **Dashboard Layout**: The dashboard will use a card-based layout with three main sections:
   - Quick Actions grid
   - Recent Files list
   - Charts & Analytics section

3. **Data State Management**: Views access data through a central data manager to ensure consistency.

4. **Empty State Handling**: All views have meaningful empty states that guide users on next steps.

5. **Memory Management**: We're implementing efficient data handling for large datasets.

6. **Dashboard Service**: We've implemented a centralized service for dashboard data to separate business logic from UI components.

## Implementation Strategy

Our approach to UI enhancement follows these phases:

1. **Build Reusable UI Components**: Create a consistent component library
2. **Enhance Navigation and State Management**: Improve application flow
3. **Redesign Dashboard**: Implement a modern card-based dashboard

## Recent Decisions

1. **Dashboard Component Design**: We've created standalone, reusable dashboard components that can be composed in different arrangements, making the dashboard more flexible and maintainable.

2. **Trend Indicators**: For the StatCard component, we're using colored text indicators for trend visualization, with green for positive trends and red for negative trends.

3. **Action Card Design**: ActionCards now support usage tracking to identify popular actions and include tag support for categorization, enabling better organization and analytics.

## Implementation Strategy

We are taking a phased approach to implementing the Dashboard Redesign:

### Phase 3a: Dashboard Components
1. âœ… Create StatCard component for statistics display
2. âœ… Implement RecentFilesList with detailed metadata
3. âœ… Add WelcomeStateWidget for first-time users
4. âœ… Implement DashboardService for data integration
5. ðŸš§ Implement ActionCard for grouped actions

### Phase 3b: Dashboard Service
1. âœ… Create DashboardService for statistics and chart data
2. âœ… Implement data change monitoring
3. âœ… Add frequently used actions tracking
4. âœ… Create dashboard configuration management

### Phase 3c: Dashboard View Integration
1. ðŸš§ Refactor DashboardView to use new components
2. ðŸš§ Implement state transitions
3. ðŸš§ Create DashboardViewAdapter
4. ðŸš§ Update MainWindow integration

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Dashboard Components**:
   - Implement ActionCard component

2. **Begin Dashboard View Integration**:
   - Create DashboardViewAdapter to connect components
   - Implement layout and state transitions
   - Connect to DashboardService for data

3. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Ensure all components work together
   - Test with various data scenarios
   - Optimize performance

## Technical Considerations

1. **Trend Calculation**: DashboardService now tracks historical values to calculate trends for StatCard components.

2. **Chart Rendering**: The ChartPreview component handles efficient rendering of matplotlib charts within the Qt framework.

3. **Performance**: Dashboard remains responsive even with multiple components and real-time updates through signal batching.

4. **Widget Communication**: Components communicate through a well-defined signal/slot mechanism with the DashboardService as intermediary.

5. **Test Mocking**: For testing the dashboard components, we've mocked the data service and chart generation.

## Component Implementation Details

## Report Generation System

We are planning a report generation system that will allow users to create custom reports from their chest data. This system will:

1. **Define Report Templates**: Create predefined templates for common reports
2. **Support Custom Reports**: Allow users to define custom report layouts
3. **Export Options**: Provide multiple export formats (PDF, HTML, CSV)
4. **Visualization Integration**: Include charts and graphs in reports
5. **Scheduling**: Allow automated report generation on a schedule

This feature will be implemented after completing the current UI enhancement phases.

### Recent Decisions

1. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Import/Export are actions, not views - moved to toolbar
   - Data, Analysis, and Reports views require data to be loaded
   - Dashboard, Settings, and Help always accessible

2. **Data View Priority**:
   - Data view is the primary interaction point after data loading
   - Empty states should provide clear path to data loading

3. **Empty State Handling**:
   - Each view has customized empty state messaging and icons
   - Action buttons in empty states trigger data import
   - BaseView now manages empty state display logic

4. **Component Reusability**:
   - Created a more extendable BaseView with QStackedWidget for content/empty states
   - Used EmptyStateWidget consistently across all data-dependent views
   - Standardized action button styling and behavior

5. **Memory Management**:
   - Improved object ownership for more reliable cleanup
   - Fixed potential memory leaks in background workers
