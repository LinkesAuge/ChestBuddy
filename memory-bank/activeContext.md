# Active Context: DataView Refactoring

Last Updated: 2024-08-05

## Current Focus
We are currently implementing a comprehensive refactoring of the DataView component, which is the central data display mechanism in ChestBuddy. This refactoring aims to enhance modularity, improve performance, and add new capabilities for data visualization and interaction.

## Key Objectives

1. **Component Architecture**: Implement a modular component architecture that separates concerns between data models, views, delegates, and adapters
2. **Enhanced Validation**: Improve visual feedback for data validation with clear status indicators
3. **Correction Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the correction system with the DataView UI
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure high performance with large datasets through optimized rendering
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain high test coverage throughout the refactoring

## Recent Changes

- Created architectural design for new DataView component structure
- Designed delegate pattern for cell rendering and interaction
- Established core API contracts between components
- Defined data flow patterns and component interactions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Models and Views (Current)
- Implement the DataViewModel and FilterModel
- Create the DataTableView and HeaderView components
- Establish basic interaction patterns and behaviors

### Phase 2: Delegate System
- Implement the CellDelegate base class
- Create specialized delegates for validation and correction
- Connect delegates to the data view components

### Phase 3: Adapter Integration
- Implement ValidationAdapter for validation service integration
- Create CorrectionAdapter for correction service integration
- Connect adapters to the relevant delegates

### Phase 4: Context Menus and Actions
- Implement context menu system for data cells
- Create specialized actions for common operations
- Connect menu system to services via adapters

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading and viewport rendering
- Add caching for validation and correction states
- Optimize data transformation and rendering

### Phase 6: Testing and Integration
- Develop comprehensive test suite for components
- Test integration with existing services
- Verify backward compatibility with current implementations

## Active Decisions

1. **Component Granularity**: Fine-grained components for maintainability.
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Used to connect UI layer with domain services.
3. **Delegate Approach**: Used for cell rendering and interaction.
4. **Qt Model Roles**: Custom roles for specialized data (ValidationState, CorrectionState).
5. **Context Menu Strategy**: Dynamic menus based on selection/state.
6. **State Management**: Adapters update a central `TableStateManager` (details TBD).

## Technical Constraints
1. **Qt Framework**: PySide6/Qt6.
2. **Performance**: Handle 10,000+ rows efficiently.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility where possible.
4. **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux.

#### Current Status

We are between **Phase 2 (Delegates)** and **Phase 3 (Adapters)**.

2.  **Implement Phase 1 Items**: Address data loading, column handling, basic UI controls.
3.  **Advanced Context Menu**: Implement context-specific actions.

This refactoring project represents a significant improvement to the ChestBuddy application's data handling capabilities and will address multiple limitations in the current implementation.

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle custom data types in the delegate system?
2. What's the best approach for optimizing large dataset rendering?
3. How should the context menu handle multiple selection scenarios?
4. What's the optimal strategy for background validation processing?

# Active Development Context

## Active Context - August 5, 2024

### DataView Refactoring Project Initiation

We are initiating a comprehensive refactoring of the DataView component, which is a central element of the ChestBuddy application responsible for displaying, validating, and allowing interaction with chest data. The current implementation has shown limitations in handling validation statuses, providing effective user interaction through context menus, and supporting advanced data manipulation features.

#### Refactoring Goals

1. **Implement a robust validation status display**:
   - Clear visual indicators for different validation statuses
   - Consistent mapping between validation results and cell states
   - Improved tooltip information for validation issues

2. **Enhance context menu functionality**:
   - Support for context-sensitive actions
   - Efficient handling of multi-selection operations
   - Integration with correction and validation workflows
   - Support for adding entries to correction and validation lists

3. **Improve data interaction**:
   - Support for bulk operations
   - Enhanced copy/paste functionality
   - Efficient cell editing workflow
   - Support for data import and export

4. **Refine architecture and performance**:
   - Clearer component boundaries
   - Improved performance with large datasets
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Better testability

#### Project Structure

The refactored DataView will follow a clear and logical folder structure:

```
chestbuddy/
├── ui/
│   ├── data/                       # DataView-specific components
│   │   ├── models/                 # Data models
│   │   ├── views/                  # View components
│   │   ├── delegates/              # Cell rendering delegates
│   │   ├── adapters/               # Adapter components

├── tests/
    ├── ui/
    │   ├── data/                   # Tests for DataView components
```

#### Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1: Core DataView Implementation**
   - Establish new folder structure
   - Implement base classes (DataViewModel, DataTableView)
   - Add core functionality (data loading, selection, columns)

2. **Phase 2: Context Menu Implementation**
   - Design context menu architecture
   - Implement standard actions
   - Add advanced functionality

3. **Phase 3: Validation and Correction Integration**
   - Implement validation status display
   - Connect to correction system
   - Add inline correction suggestions

4. **Phase 4: Import/Export and Advanced Features**
   - Implement import/export
   - Add search and filter
   - Optimize performance

#### Current Status

We are currently in **Phase 1: Core DataView Implementation**, wrapping up basic view features and moving towards context menu and delegate implementation.

- ✅ Project overview documentation
- ✅ UI mockups for main view, context menu, validation, and correction integration
- ✅ Project structure documentation

2. Add tests for `ValidationDelegate` painting logic.
3. Implement `CorrectionDelegate`.
4. Implement `ValidationAdapter` and `CorrectionAdapter`.
5. Add advanced context menu features.

This refactoring project represents a significant improvement to the ChestBuddy application's data handling capabilities and will address multiple limitations in the current implementation.

#### Detailed Testing Strategy

Our testing approach for the DataView refactoring includes:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test each component in isolation with mocked dependencies
   - Verify component behavior against specifications
   - Test edge cases and error handling
   - Aim for 95% code coverage

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify signal/slot connections
   - Test data flow between components
   - Validate state management across component boundaries

3. **UI Testing**:
   - Test rendering accuracy
   - Verify user interaction handling
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Validate accessibility features

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark with large datasets (10,000+ rows)
   - Measure rendering performance
   - Test memory usage
   - Verify responsive UI during intensive operations

We have developed comprehensive testing plans for each component, with detailed test cases and coverage targets. All tests will use pytest with pytest-qt for Qt-specific testing.

#### Visualization and User Experience

The refactored DataView will provide enhanced visual cues for validation status:

- **Valid cells**: White background
- **Invalid cells**: Light red background with error indicator
- **Correctable cells**: Light yellow background with correction indicator
- **Warning cells**: Light orange background with warning indicator
- **Info cells**: Light blue background with info indicator

The context menu will be context-sensitive, displaying different options based on:
- Current selection (single/multiple cells)
- Cell state (valid/invalid/correctable)
- Selected content type (text/number/date)

These visual improvements will significantly enhance the user's ability to identify and address data issues efficiently.
