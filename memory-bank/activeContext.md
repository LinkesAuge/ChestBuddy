# Active Development Context

## Active Context - May 16, 2024

### Recent Codebase Cleanup
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/correction_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/chart_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/views/correction_view_adapter.py`, marking these components as legacy
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/views/chart_view_adapter.py`, noting that it will be replaced by a future ChartView component
- Removed `chestbuddy/core/service_locator.py` and consolidated to `chestbuddy/utils/service_locator.py`
- Deleted `chestbuddy/ui/validation_tab.py` as it's been fully replaced by ValidationTabView
- Documented migration status of UI components in `codebase_cleanup.md`
- Updated `tests/test_main_window.py` to work with the new MainWindow constructor, fixing test failures

### Key Tasks in Progress
1. Modernizing the UI architecture from tab-based to view-based design

## Recent Codebase Cleanup

We have performed a cleanup of redundant code in the ChestBuddy application:

1. **Removed redundant service_locator.py** from the core directory, as it duplicated functionality in utils/service_locator.py
2. **Added deprecation warnings** to legacy UI components that are being phased out:
   - correction_tab.py
   - chart_tab.py
   - correction_view_adapter.py (identified that MainWindow already uses CorrectionView directly)
   - chart_view_adapter.py (identified that it will need a ChartView replacement)
3. **Deleted legacy UI component** no longer in use:
   - validation_tab.py (replaced by ValidationTabView)
   - Updated test_ui_components.py to use ValidationTabView
4. **Marked signal_tracer.py** as a debug-only utility
5. **Created documentation** for future cleanup tasks in memory-bank/codebase_cleanup.md
6. **Documented migration status** of UI components in codebase_cleanup.md

These changes are part of our ongoing effort to modernize the codebase by moving from the tab-based UI to a view-based architecture. The next phase will involve implementing a ChartView component to replace ChartViewAdapter, followed by updating tests to use the new components directly.

## Current Focus: Complete CorrectionView UI Implementation

We are currently focused on completing the UI implementation for the correction feature in the ChestBuddy application, specifically the CorrectionView. This involves implementing the remaining UI elements according to the mockup design and ensuring proper integration with the existing functionality.

### Implemented Features

- âœ… Status bar in CorrectionRuleView showing rule counts (Total: X | Enabled: Y | Disabled: Z)
- âœ… Color legend in DataView explaining the different highlight colors for cells
- âœ… Consistent cell highlighting with colors matching the legend
- âœ… Update mechanism for cell highlighting via update_cell_highlighting method
- âœ… Import/Export buttons in the header of CorrectionRuleView
- âœ… Fixed deletion issues where the wrong rules were being deleted
- âœ… Simplified CorrectionRule data structure by removing redundant 'order' and 'description' fields

### Missing Features

- ðŸ”„ Context menu for data cells with options for individual and batch correction
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced Import/Export dialog with file format selection and preview
- ðŸ”„ Improved batch correction dialog with better pattern recognition
- ðŸ”„ Settings panel with configuration options

### Current Tasks

1. Implement context menu for DataView cells with the following options:
   - Apply correction rules to selected cells
   - Apply specific rule to selected cells
   - Batch correction for similar values
   - View validation details

2. Enhance Import/Export dialog with:
   - File format selection (CSV, Excel, JSON)
   - Preview of rules before importing
   - Options for handling duplicates
   - Filtering options for export

3. Improve batch correction dialog:
   - Better pattern recognition for similar errors
   - Preview of validation results
   - Auto-correction suggestions
   - Optimization for multiple cell selection

4. Add settings panel with configuration checkboxes for:
   - Auto-correction preferences
   - Validation options
   - Display settings

### Next Steps

1. Implement context menu for rule table with quick actions
2. Connect settings to ConfigManager for persistence
3. Enhance filter controls with additional options
4. Create unit tests for new UI components

### Key Decisions

1. Replaced MainWindow status bar with dedicated QStatusBar in CorrectionView
2. Implementation of file dialog integration for rule import/export
3. Use of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for remaining features
4. Follow UI component style guidelines from mockup
5. Prioritize user experience with responsive feedback
6. Simplified CorrectionRule data structure by removing 'order' field and implementing implicit ordering
7. Further simplified CorrectionRule by removing unused 'description' field
8. Added robust error handling for all rule operations

## Recent Model Changes

We've made important simplifications to the correction rule data model:

1. **Removed Order Field**: The 'order' field has been removed from CorrectionRule. Rules are now ordered implicitly by their position in the list, making the code more intuitive and removing redundancy.

2. **Removed Description Field**: The 'description' field has been removed as it was unused and added unnecessary complexity to the data structure.

3. **Fixed Deletion Issues**: Implemented a more robust approach to rule deletion that prevents multiple rules from being deleted accidentally.

These changes have significantly simplified the data structure and made the correction feature more maintainable.

## DataView Integration

The integration between the DataView and correction components is a critical part of the implementation, focusing on user experience and visual feedback.

### Current Integration Work

1. Context Menu Integration
   - Adding context menu for cells to perform corrections
   - Connecting menu actions to the controller
   - Handling selection states for contextual options

2. Visual Feedback
   - Cell highlighting based on correction status
   - Color-coded cells for different states
   - Tooltips providing details on cell status

3. Controller Enhancements
   - Adding methods to apply corrections to selections
   - Implementing batch correction operations
   - Optimizing validation and correction workflows

4. UI Flow Implementation
   - Ensuring smooth transitions between dialogs
   - Maintaining UI state during operations
   - Providing progress feedback for long-running tasks

### Recent Changes

1. Added Import/Export buttons to CorrectionRuleView header
2. Fixed test compatibility issues
3. Updated cell highlighting to match color legend
4. Enhanced CorrectionController with cell status methods
5. Simplified CorrectionRule data structure
6. Fixed issues with rule deletion
