# Current Focus

We are currently focused on expanding test coverage for all functionality and UI components of the ChestBuddy application. We have successfully implemented background processing for CSV file operations, which is a significant performance improvement. We are now enhancing the test suite with comprehensive UI interaction tests using QtBot to ensure the application functions correctly from the user's perspective.

## Implementation Plan

We are following a phase-based implementation approach:

- âœ… Phase 1: CSV Encoding Enhancement
- âœ… Phase 2: Test Suite Maintenance
- âœ… Phase 3: UI Optimizations
- âœ… Phase 4: Background CSV Processing
- âœ… Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Test Coverage Expansion
  - âœ… Tests for MainWindow functionality
  - âœ… Enhanced UI component tests with QtBot
  - ðŸ”„ Integration tests for cross-component workflows
  - â¬œ End-to-end workflow tests
  - â¬œ Background processing tests
  - â¬œ Performance tests

## Recent Changes

- Created a comprehensive test coverage expansion plan
- Identified gaps in test coverage and prioritized areas for improvement
- Created tests for the MainWindow class, covering initialization, menu actions, toolbar actions, tab switching, and window state persistence
- Enhanced UI component tests for DataView, ValidationTab, and CorrectionTab with QtBot to test direct user interactions
- Added tests for filtering, cell editing, validation rule selection, correction strategy selection, and row selection options
- Used a combination of mocked tests for unit testing and QtBot-based tests for UI interaction testing

## Current Status

- All tests are passing
- CSV encoding detection is robust and works well with various file formats
- Test coverage for UI components has been significantly improved with direct interaction tests
- Background processing for CSV operations is implemented and tested
- Memory usage for large datasets has been optimized

## Key Issues

- Test Suite: Partially Resolved âœ…/ðŸ”„
  - Basic tests are passing
  - UI component tests have been enhanced with QtBot
  - Still need integration tests
- Performance: Mostly Resolved âœ…
  - Background processing implemented
  - Memory optimization complete
  - No remaining significant performance issues
- UI: Resolved âœ…
  - All components are functional
  - UI is responsive
- Encoding Detection: Resolved âœ…
  - Robust algorithm implemented
  - Handles edge cases

## Active Decisions

- Test Coverage Strategy: We are following a comprehensive testing approach that includes:
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Direct UI interaction tests using QtBot
  - Integration tests for cross-component workflows (planned)
  - End-to-end workflow tests (planned)

- UI Testing Approach: We are using a combination of:
  - Mocked tests for basic functionality verification
  - QtBot-based tests for direct UI interaction
  - Signal catchers for verifying signal emissions

- Integration Testing Scope: We have decided to implement integration tests that verify:
  - Data flow between components
  - Signal-slot connections
  - Cross-component workflows

- Performance Testing: We will include performance tests to ensure:
  - Background processing works correctly
  - Memory usage remains optimized
  - UI remains responsive during heavy operations

## Critical Path

1. âœ… Implement MainWindow tests
2. âœ… Enhance UI component tests with QtBot
3. ðŸ”„ Implement integration tests for cross-component workflows
4. â¬œ Create end-to-end workflow tests
5. â¬œ Add background processing tests
6. â¬œ Implement performance tests

## Design Considerations

- Balance between test coverage expansion and new feature implementation
- Ensuring tests remain maintainable and don't become brittle
- Focus on user experience and actual usage patterns in tests
- Test-driven approach for future development
