# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are in the initial setup phase of the Chest Buddy project. The primary focus is on establishing the project structure, core architecture, and UI design before implementation.

## Recent Changes
- Created project repository
- Initialized basic files (README.md, main.py, pyproject.toml)
- Set up virtual environment with Python 3.12
- Established Memory Bank for project documentation
- Defined project requirements and architecture
- Created comprehensive UI design mockups
- Created interactive HTML UI example in docs/UI-example.html

## Current Decisions
- Using PySide6 for GUI development
- Following MVC architecture pattern
- Implementing modular design with clear component separation
- Using Pandas for data handling
- Using UV for dependency management
- Storing project documentation in Memory Bank
- Adopting a left-side navigation bar with main content area layout
- Using dark theme with dark blue and gold color scheme

## UI Design Decisions
- Implemented left-side navigation with collapsible sections
- Created comprehensive mockups for all main application sections
- Created interactive HTML example to showcase UI styling and layout
- Used CSS variables for consistent color theming
- Implemented responsive grid layouts for dashboard components
- Designed dashboard with statistics and quick actions
- Structured data management screens (Import, Validate, Correct, Export)
- Designed analysis views with filter controls and visualization options
- Created report generation interface with customization options
- Established settings screens for validation lists and correction rules
- Defined color scheme: dark blue (#1A2C42), gold (#D4AF37), with appropriate accents
- Chosen typography: Roboto/Open Sans with appropriate sizing hierarchy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Set up project directory structure
2. Create base classes for core components
3. Implement the ConfigManager for application settings
4. Build basic UI skeleton with PySide6 based on approved mockups and HTML example
5. Implement the navigation bar and main content area layout
6. Create CSV import functionality
7. Develop initial data model for chest data

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement validation system for data
2. Develop correction rules management
3. Build data visualization components
4. Create basic report generation

### Medium-term Goals
1. Complete all core feature implementations
2. Implement full validation and correction system
3. Develop comprehensive reporting system
4. Create full suite of charts and visualizations

## Open Questions
- Best approach for handling character encoding issues with German umlauts
- Most efficient data structure for large datasets with frequent filtering
- Strategy for implementing fuzzy matching for correction rules
- Approach for threading long-running operations to maintain UI responsiveness

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper handling of character encoding across different systems
- Designing a flexible yet efficient validation system
- Balancing automatic correction with user control
- Creating an intuitive UI for managing complex correction rules
- Translating HTML/CSS example to equivalent PySide6 implementation

## Technical Debt
None identified yet, as the project is in early stages.

## Current Development Environment
- Python 3.12
- PySide6
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- UV for dependency management
