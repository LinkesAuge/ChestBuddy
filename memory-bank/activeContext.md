## Current Focus

### Test Suite Maintenance and Improvement

We're currently focused on fixing and improving the test suite. Several tests have been breaking due to changes in the API of the application components. Key issues addressed so far:

1. Fixed methods in `ChestDataModel` by updating UI components to use `get_validation_status()` instead of `get_all_validation_status()` and `get_correction_status()` instead of `get_all_correction_status()`.

2. Fixed the `DataView._on_item_changed` method to use `update_data()` instead of `update_value()`.

3. Fixed boolean checking with pandas DataFrames by using `.empty` property instead of direct boolean checks.

4. Fixed `test_services.py` to use the correct method names and parameter order.

5. Fixed `test_chest_data_model.py` to use the correct API methods.

6. Fixed proper handling of `QApplication` in tests to avoid conflicts between tests.

**Current status:**
- Test files passing: `test_app.py`, `test_chest_data_model.py`, `test_config_manager.py`, `test_default_files.py`, `test_services.py`
- Test files with issues: `test_ui_components.py` (5 failing tests)

**Remaining issues in `test_ui_components.py`:**
- Method name mismatches in UI components (e.g., `_validate_button` vs `_validate_btn`)
- Missing methods in `DataView` (`_on_filter_changed`)
- Missing methods in `CorrectionService` (`load_correction_templates`) 
- Issues with filtering implementation in `DataView`

### Key APIs Being Refactored

The main components being updated are:

1. **ChestDataModel**: Core data management class
   - Fixed method names for validation and correction status retrieval
   - Updated method for applying data changes (update_data instead of update_value)

2. **UI Components**: DataView, ValidationTab, CorrectionTab
   - Method names need to be aligned with implementation
   - Filtering implementation needs to be updated

### Dependencies/Integration Points

- **Validation and Correction Services**: Integration with model and UI components
  - Method signatures updated to match current implementation

### Next Steps

1. Complete the fixes for `test_ui_components.py`:
   - Update method names to match actual implementation
   - Fix method not found errors in the tests
   - Update assertions to match expected behavior

2. Run full test suite to ensure all tests pass

3. Update documentation to reflect current API

## Recent Changes
- Fixed the QApplication fixture to properly handle instances between tests
- Created test_default_files.py which successfully tests loading default files
- Updated several test files to match the current API implementation
- Found mismatches between test expectations and actual implementation
- Updated the bugfixing.mdc file to track current test issues

## Key Issues
1. **CSVService API Changes**: The CSVService class no longer accepts a data_model parameter in its constructor, causing tests to fail.
2. **Method Mismatches**: Several methods expected by tests don't exist in the actual implementation:
   - `filter_data()` in ChestDataModel expects a dictionary of filters, not a lambda function
   - `get_all_validation_status()` and `get_all_correction_status()` methods don't exist
   - Missing methods like `clear_validation_status()` in ChestDataModel
3. **Encoding Issues**: The default input files have encoding issues that need to be resolved

## Active Decisions
- We need to decide whether to update the tests to match the implementation or update the implementation to provide the missing methods
- For CSV encoding issues, we may need to update the CSVService to better handle different encodings

## Critical Path
1. First, fix the most critical tests (ChestDataModel, CSVService)
2. Then fix tests for dependent components (ValidationService, CorrectionService)
3. Finally, fix UI tests and application tests

## Technical Context
All tests should be updated to match the actual implementation of the components. We should ensure that tests properly clean up resources, especially the QApplication instances that can cause issues between tests.

## Design Considerations
- Tests should be independent and not rely on state from other tests
- Mock objects should be used where appropriate to avoid dependencies
- Fixtures should be used to provide common test data and avoid duplication
- Test data should include both valid and invalid examples to test error handling

## Current Challenges
- **UI Testing**: Testing UI components is challenging due to the need to handle QApplication instances correctly
- **Path Handling**: Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for file paths in tests
- **Test Isolation**: Ensuring tests don't interfere with each other, especially with shared resources
- **API Consistency**: Ensuring that tests match the current API of the components
