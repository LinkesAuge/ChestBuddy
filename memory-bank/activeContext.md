### Recent Codebase Cleanup
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/correction_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/chart_tab.py`, `chestbuddy/ui/views/correction_view_adapter.py`, marking these components as legacy
- Added deprecation warnings to `chestbuddy/ui/views/chart_view_adapter.py`, noting that it will be replaced by a future ChartView component
- Implemented new `ChartView` component to replace `ChartViewAdapter` and `ChartTab`, following the same pattern as `CorrectionView`
- Removed `chestbuddy/core/service_locator.py` and consolidated to `chestbuddy/utils/service_locator.py`
- Deleted `chestbuddy/ui/validation_tab.py` as it's been fully replaced by ValidationTabView
- Documented migration status of UI components in `codebase_cleanup.md`
- Updated `tests/test_main_window.py` to work with the new MainWindow constructor, fixing test failures
- Created comprehensive tests for `ChartView` in `tests/unit/ui/views/test_chart_view.py`

### Key Tasks in Progress
1. Modernizing the UI architecture from tab-based to view-based design
2. âœ… Updated MainWindow to use ChartView directly instead of ChartViewAdapter
3. âœ… Created tests for the new ChartView component
4. âœ… Improved test coverage for ValidationTabView from 29% to 80%
5. Update remaining tests to use the new view-based components directly

## Recent Codebase Cleanup

We have performed a cleanup of redundant code in the ChestBuddy application:

1. **Removed redundant service_locator.py** from the core directory, as it duplicated functionality in utils/service_locator.py
2. **Added deprecation warnings** to legacy UI components that are being phased out:
   - correction_tab.py
   - chart_tab.py
   - correction_view_adapter.py (identified that MainWindow already uses CorrectionView directly)
   - chart_view_adapter.py (identified that it will need a ChartView replacement)
3. **Deleted legacy UI component** no longer in use:
   - validation_tab.py (replaced by ValidationTabView)
   - Updated test_ui_components.py to use ValidationTabView
4. **Implemented new modern components**:
   - Created ChartView to replace ChartViewAdapter and ChartTab
   - Maintained API compatibility for smooth transition
5. **Marked signal_tracer.py** as a debug-only utility
6. **Created documentation** for future cleanup tasks in memory-bank/codebase_cleanup.md
7. **Documented migration status** of UI components in codebase_cleanup.md
8. **Created tests** for the new ChartView component in tests/unit/ui/views/test_chart_view.py

These changes are part of our ongoing effort to modernize the codebase by moving from the tab-based UI to a view-based architecture. The next step is to update remaining tests to use the new view components, followed by the removal of the deprecated adapter and legacy tab components.

## Technical Decisions

### View-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Replace tab-based interface with dedicated view components.

**Rationale**:
- Improved separation of concerns
- Better testability of individual components
- More modern UI approach
- Easier to add new views or rearrange existing ones

**Implementation**:
- Each view is a self-contained QWidget subclass
- MainWindow manages view switching and coordination
- Views communicate through signals/slots and view controllers
- Common functionality extracted to base classes or utility functions

### Signal/Slot Architecture

We're reinforcing our commitment to a signal/slot architecture for component communication:

1. **View Components**:
   - Emit signals when user actions occur
   - Provide slots for external actions to affect the view
   - Do not directly call methods on other components

2. **Controllers**:
   - Connect signals from views to appropriate handlers
   - Coordinate between models and views
   - Manage application state

3. **Services**:
   - Provide business logic implementation
   - Emit signals when state changes
   - Accept calls from controllers to perform operations

### Testing Strategy

We're updating our testing approach to match the new architecture:

1. **Component Tests**:
   - Test each view component in isolation
   - Mock dependencies (models, services)
   - Verify signals are emitted correctly
   - Verify UI updates in response to external signals

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify correct signal propagation
   - Test data flow through the system

3. **Signal Testing**:
   - Use qtbot.waitSignal for asynchronous operations
   - Test signal emissions with correct parameters
   - Test signal chains (when one signal triggers another)
   
4. **Controller-Based Testing**:
   - Test through controller interfaces rather than direct UI inspection
   - Verify controller methods are called with correct parameters
   - Focus on behavior rather than implementation details

# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving the correction system in ChestBuddy to address several identified issues and enhance functionality.

## Correction System Improvement Project (2023-04-01)

### Overview

We are implementing a series of improvements to the correction system to address the issue of corrections not being applied correctly. The detailed plans and documentation for this work are located in:

- `plans/correction_system_improvements_plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan using Test-Driven Development
- `plans/correction_ui_mockup.md` - User interface mockups for the improved correction system
- `plans/correction_system_technical_implementation.md` - Technical implementation details

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Recursive Correction:** Currently, corrections are only applied once. If a corrected value would match another rule, that secondary correction is not applied.
2. **Selection-Based Correction:** Users should be able to apply corrections to a specific selection of cells.
3. **Correctable Status Detection:** The system needs to identify which invalid entries can be fixed with available correction rules.
4. **Auto-Correction Options:** More flexible configuration for when corrections are automatically applied.

### Implementation Approach

We are following a Test-Driven Development approach across four primary phases:

1. **Phase 1: Recursive Correction**
   - Implement and test recursive correction functionality
   - Fix the current issue with the `apply_corrections` method parameters

2. **Phase 2: Selection-Based Correction**
   - Enable applying corrections to selected data only
   - Implement context menu and UI integration

3. **Phase 3: Correctable Status Detection**
   - Extend ValidationStatus enum with CORRECTABLE state
   - Implement detection of correctable entries

4. **Phase 4: Auto-Correction Options**
   - Add configuration options for auto-correction
   - Implement UI components for correction settings

## Recent Changes

- Fixed a bug in the `_apply_corrections_task` method where it was incorrectly passing the `recursive` parameter to the `apply_corrections` method
- Created comprehensive planning documents for the correction system improvements
- Designed UI mockups for the improved correction features

## Next Steps

1. Implement tests for the recursive correction functionality
2. Implement recursive correction in the CorrectionService and CorrectionController
3. Update the ValidationStatus enum to include correctable states
4. Implement the UI changes according to the mockups
5. Update the configuration manager to include new correction settings

## Active Decisions

- We have decided to extend the ValidationStatus enum with CORRECTABLE and CORRECTED states
- We will implement the recursive correction with cycle detection to prevent infinite loops
- We will add selection-based correction with context menu integration
- We will enhance the correction UI to show correctable items and correction counts
