# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing a comprehensive test suite for the ChestBuddy application. We have successfully created tests for all major components, including:

- **Core Utilities**: Tests for the ConfigManager class.
- **Data Models**: Tests for BaseModel and ChestDataModel.
- **Services**: Tests for CSVService, ValidationService, and CorrectionService.
- **UI Components**: Tests for DataView, ValidationTab, CorrectionTab, and MainWindow.
- **Application**: Tests for the main ChestBuddyApp class.

The tests are located in the `tests/` directory and follow a structured pattern. We've also created sample test data in `tests/data/` to facilitate testing validation and correction functionality.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the full application structure with models, services, and UI components
- Created a comprehensive test suite for all components
- Added test data files for testing validation and correction
- Implemented a test runner script with coverage reporting
- Updated progress tracking to reflect completion of the testing phase

## Next Steps
1. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Add more robust error handling for edge cases
   - Implement better error reporting to the user
   - Add logging for errors to assist with debugging

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize data loading for large datasets
   - Improve rendering performance for large tables
   - Implement pagination for data display

3. **Chart Integration**:
   - Design the chart interface
   - Implement chart functionality using matplotlib
   - Create chart tab to display visualizations

4. **Report Generation**:
   - Design report templates
   - Implement report generation functionality
   - Add export options for reports

## Active Decisions
- **Testing Framework**: Using pytest for all testing due to its flexibility and ease of use
- **Test Coverage**: Aiming for at least 80% test coverage for core components
- **UI Testing**: Limited to component initialization and signal connection testing due to challenges with automated UI testing
- **Test Data**: Created both valid and invalid test data to comprehensively test validation and correction

## Current Challenges
- **UI Testing**: Testing UI components thoroughly without manual interaction is challenging
- **Path Handling**: Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for file paths in tests
- **Test Isolation**: Ensuring tests don't interfere with each other, especially with the singleton ConfigManager
