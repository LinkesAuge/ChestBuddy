# Active Context: ChestBuddy Application

## Current State

The application architecture is stable with all core functionality implemented. The application has successfully transitioned to a controller-based architecture, with all UI components now using the appropriate controllers for business logic operations. 

We have implemented a SignalManager utility to centralize and improve signal connection management, including throttling capabilities to improve UI performance with rapidly firing signals.

### Current Implementation Focus

We are implementing the **Signal Connection Management Improvement Plan** to address issues with signal connection management in ChestBuddy:

1. **SignalManager Utility**: A utility class for managing PySide6 signal connections
   - Tracks all signal connections
   - Prevents duplicate connections
   - Provides centralized disconnection methods
   - Includes safety mechanisms and context managers
   - Offers debugging tools for connection tracking
   - Implements throttling for rapidly firing signals

2. **Signal Connection Standards**: Standardized patterns for signal connections across the application
   - Defines signal naming conventions (verb_noun, noun_changed, noun_requested, etc.)
   - Establishes slot naming conventions (_on_signal_name, etc.)
   - Creates standardized connection patterns for view adapters
   - Provides consistent error handling and debugging
   - Ensures proper signal disconnection during cleanup

3. **Overall Implementation Plan Progress**:

     - Integrated throttled connections with existing management features ✓
     - Added throttling information to the connection debugging tools ✓
   - Phase 6 (Connection Safety Enhancements) - *In Progress*
     - Implement connection priority management
     - Create stronger typechecking for signal connections
     - Enhance debugging tools for signal flow visualization

### Next Implementation Steps

For Phase 6 (Connection Safety Enhancements), we will focus on:

1. **Connection Priority Management**
   - Implement a mechanism to control the order in which signal handlers are called
   - Create priority levels for different types of connections
   - Ensure critical handlers are called before less important ones
   - Add connection sorting based on priority

2. **Strong Type Checking for Signal Connections**
   - Add type checking for signal parameters and slot parameters
   - Implement runtime type verification
   - Add warnings or errors for type mismatches
   - Create decorators for type-safe signal connections

3. **Enhanced Debugging Tools**

### Application Architecture

The application architecture follows a clean controller-based organization:

1. **Core Layer**:
   - Models: ChestDataModel, ValidationModel
   - Services: CSVService, ValidationService, CorrectionService, ChartService
   - Controllers: FileOperationsController, ProgressController, ErrorHandlingController, ViewStateController, DataViewController, UIStateController

2. **UI Layer**:
   - MainWindow: Main application window (delegates to controllers)
   - Views: Dashboard, Data, Validation, Correction, Charts

3. **Utils Layer**:
   - Configuration
   - Logging
   - File operations helpers
   - **SignalManager**: Utility for signal connection management
   - **Signal Standards**: Reference for signal naming and connection patterns

### Current UI Navigation

The navigation system uses a sidebar that provides access to:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of data and recent files
2. **Data**: Tabular view of imported data
3. **Validation**: View and resolve validation issues
4. **Correction**: Apply automated corrections to data
5. **Charts**: Visualize data in various chart formats

### Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: Large datasets (>100,000 rows) can consume significant memory
2. **UI Performance**: Updates to the UI thread can cause momentary freezing with large datasets
3. **Thread Cleanup**: Minor QThread object deletion warning at shutdown (non-critical)
4. **Controller Tests**: Some controller tests that require QApplication need to be updated to use pytest-qt

### Column Name Standardization

The application supports diverse CSV file formats through:

- Column name mapping to standardize input data (using `EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]`)
- Case-insensitive comparison for column identification
- Regular expression patterns for fuzzy matching similar columns
- Default column templates for easy mapping

## Signal Management Architecture

The SignalManager and signal connection system now includes throttling capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    SM[SignalManager] --> RC[Regular Connections]
    SM --> TC[Throttled Connections]
    SM --> CB[Context Managers]
    SM --> UT[Utility Methods]
    
    RC --> CT[Connection Tracking]
    RC --> CD[Connection Debugging]
    
    TC --> TM[Throttle Mode]
    TC --> DM[Debounce Mode]
    TC --> TD[Throttled Debugging]
    
    TM -->|Calls immediately| SR[Slot Receiver]
    DM -->|Waits for quiet period| SR
    
    CB --> BS[Blocked Signals]
    UT --> SC[Safe Connect]
    UT --> IS[Is Connected]
    UT --> GC[Get Connections]
    
    style SM fill:#2C5282,color:#fff
    style TC fill:#1E3A5F,color:#fff
    style TM fill:#1E3A5F,color:#fff
    style DM fill:#1E3A5F,color:#fff
```

The throttling functionality supports two modes:
1. **Throttle Mode**: First event fires immediately, then ignores events until the timer expires
2. **Debounce Mode**: Waits for events to stop coming in before firing, using the most recent values
