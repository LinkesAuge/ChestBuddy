# Active Context

*Last Updated: April 21, 2024*

## Current Focus

We are currently refactoring the correction feature in the ChestBuddy application. The key aspects of this refactoring include:

1. Implementing precise cell-level corrections that can be applied in a targeted manner
2. Creating a rule-based approach with CSV-based rule management
3. Implementing a better UI experience for managing and applying correction rules
4. Optimizing performance for large datasets
5. Integrating with the validation system

## Implementation Plan

The refactoring is divided into phases:

### Phase 1: Core Data Model ✓
- [x] Create `CorrectionRule` model class
- [x] Implement `CorrectionRuleManager` for rule management
- [x] Add unit tests for both classes

### Phase 2: Services Layer ✓
- [x] Implement `CorrectionService` with two-pass correction algorithm
- [x] Add configuration integration through `ConfigManager`
- [x] Ensure comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Controller Layer ✓
- [x] Create `CorrectionController` to bridge service with UI
- [x] Implement background processing for performance
- [x] Add event-based communication
- [x] Add unit tests for the controller

### Phase 4: UI Components (In Progress)
- [ ] Design and implement rules management dialog
- [ ] Create rule editing interface
- [ ] Add visual feedback for corrections
- [ ] Ensure accessibility and usability

## Current Tasks

1. ✓ Model layer: Complete with `CorrectionRule` and `CorrectionRuleManager`
2. ✓ Services layer: Complete with `CorrectionService` implementation
3. ✓ Controller layer: Complete with `CorrectionController` implementation
4. In progress: Working on the UI components for rule management and correction application

## Technical Decisions

1. Two-pass correction algorithm:
   - First pass applies general rules
   - Second pass applies specific category-based rules
   
2. Background processing pattern:
   - UI stays responsive during rule application
   - Progress reporting through signals
   
3. CSV file format:
   - Simple, human-readable format
   - Easily editable outside the application
   
4. Rule prioritization:
   - Category-specific rules take precedence over general rules
   - Rules can be explicitly disabled
   - Priority within categories can be adjusted

## Progress Summary

We have successfully completed Phase 1 (Core Data Model), Phase 2 (Services Layer), and Phase 3 (Controller Layer) of our correction feature refactoring plan:

1. Implemented the `CorrectionRule` model class that provides:
   - A clean API for representing correction rules
   - Support for rule categories (player, chest_type, source, general)
   - Rule status management (enabled/disabled)
   - Order-based prioritization
   - Serialization to/from dictionaries for CSV storage

2. Implemented the `CorrectionRuleManager` class that provides:
   - Loading and saving rules from/to CSV files
   - CRUD operations for rule management
   - Filtering capabilities for category and status
   - Rule prioritization and ordering functionality
   - Prevention of duplicate rules

3. Implemented the `CorrectionService` class that provides:
   - Two-pass correction algorithm (general rules first, then category-specific)
   - Support for applying corrections to all cells or only invalid cells
   - Methods for previewing corrections before applying
   - Correction history tracking
   - Case sensitivity options for matching
   - Integration with data model and validation service

4. Implemented the `CorrectionController` class that provides:
   - Full rule management functionality (add, update, delete, reorder)
   - Background processing for performance optimization
   - Signal-based event communication
   - Integration with CorrectionService and CorrectionRuleManager
   - Methods for applying corrections and previewing results
   - Support for importing/exporting rules

5. Created comprehensive unit tests:
   - 10 test cases for CorrectionRule
   - 20 test cases for CorrectionRuleManager
   - 17 test cases for CorrectionService
   - 23 test cases for CorrectionController
   - All tests pass successfully

We are now starting Phase 4 (UI Components) which focuses on implementing the user interface for the correction feature and integrating it with the existing data view.

## Ongoing Discussions

1. **Future Enhancements**
   - Potential implementation of smart matching using NLP techniques
   - Auto-suggestion of rules based on patterns
   - Performance optimizations for very large datasets

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Vectorized operations for efficiently processing large datasets
   - Chunked processing to maintain UI responsiveness
   - Caching validation results to avoid redundant calculations
