# Active Context

Updated: 2025-03-24

## Current Focus

We are implementing a comprehensive UI Enhancement to improve user experience, particularly for the data loading workflow and data visualization. We've completed several key components of our UI enhancement plan:

### Reusable UI Components (Completed)
We have implemented several reusable UI components following a test-driven development approach:

1. **ActionButton**: A customizable button with support for text, icons, tooltip, and styling options.
   - Features: Compact mode, primary styling, named buttons
   - Tests: Initialization, styling, interactions

2. **ActionToolbar**: A toolbar that organizes ActionButtons into logical groups.
   - Features: Horizontal/vertical orientation, button grouping with separators, button management
   - Tests: Layout, grouping, button interactions

3. **EmptyStateWidget**: A widget for displaying empty state information with optional action button.
   - Features: Title, message, action button, icon support
   - Tests: Initialization, content updating, action handling

4. **FilterBar**: A search and filter bar for data tables.
   - Features: Search field, expandable filter section, multiple filter categories
   - Tests: Search functionality, filter selection, expand/collapse behavior

### Next Steps
- Integrate these components into the Data view 
- Implement the Dashboard redesign with empty state handling
- Update the sidebar navigation to handle data state

The overall UI Enhancement plan addresses several key aspects:

1. **Navigation and State Management**:
   - Modify SidebarNavigation to support disabled states for views
   - Remove Import/Export from navigation sidebar (as they're actions, not views)
   - Implement data_loaded state tracking in MainWindow
   - Make Data, Analysis, and Reports views dependent on data being loaded
   - Provide clear visual feedback when views are disabled

2. **Dashboard Enhancement**:
   - Create EmptyStateWidget for prominent display when no data is loaded
   - Add clear visual guidance and call-to-action for importing data
   - Design smooth transition between empty and populated states
   - Make import action visually prominent in empty state
   - Update dashboard layout to better showcase data when available

3. **Data View Optimization**:
   - Redesign Data view with compact header to maximize table space
   - Group action buttons logically (data, processing, utility actions)
   - Implement streamlined filtering interface directly above table
   - Create compact status bar for showing filter state and row counts
   - Optimize table layout for maximum data visibility

This UI Enhancement builds upon our previous work on improving the CSV import process, creating a more intuitive and user-friendly experience throughout the application.

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this time

### Column Name Standardization

We've updated the `ChestDataModel.EXPECTED_COLUMNS` to match the actual column names in our standard CSV file (`Chests_input_test.csv`). The columns are now defined using uppercase names:

```python
EXPECTED_COLUMNS = ["DATE", "PLAYER", "SOURCE", "CHEST", "SCORE", "CLAN"]
```

Previously, we were using title case column names like "Player Name", but our CSV files actually use uppercase names like "PLAYER". This mismatch was causing data to not display properly in the table view.

We've also updated the `DataManager._map_columns` method to include a default mapping between old column names and new ones to maintain compatibility with existing code that might be using the old column names.

Tests have been updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that all references to column names use the new uppercase format.

### CSV Operations Refactoring 

### Multi-Cell Paste Enhancement

We've improved the user experience by implementing multi-cell paste functionality, allowing users to select multiple cells in the table and paste content to all of them simultaneously. The key improvements include:

1. Modified the `_paste_cell` method in `DataView` to handle multiple selections
2. Added a context menu option that shows "Paste to all X selected cells" when multiple cells are selected
3. Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+V) for paste operations
4. Added better logging for paste operations to improve debugging

This enhancement allows for more efficient data entry and editing, especially when the same value needs to be applied to multiple cells. Users can now:

1. Select multiple cells by clicking and dragging or using Ctrl+click for non-adjacent selections
2. Press Ctrl+V or use the right-click context menu to paste to all selected cells
3. See immediate feedback as all selected cells are updated simultaneously

### Column Name Standardization 

## Current Focus: CSV Loading Improvements

We are implementing enhancements to the CSV file loading process to improve performance and user experience with large files. The current implementation causes the application to freeze during loading with no visual feedback.

### Implementation Plan for CSV Loading Improvements

1. **Create MultiCSVLoadTask Class**
   - Create a new class extending BackgroundTask
   - Handle loading multiple files with progress reporting
   - Use chunked reading for better memory efficiency

2. **Update DataManager**
   - Add new signals:
     - `load_progress(str, int, int)` for file name, current progress, total
     - `load_started()` and `load_finished()` for UI feedback
   - Modify `load_csv` to use the new task
   - Implement cancellation support

3. **Add Progress Dialog in MainWindow**
   - Create QProgressDialog when loading starts
   - Update the dialog as loading progresses
   - Support cancellation with proper cleanup
   - Close dialog when loading completes

4. **Use Efficient File Processing**
   - Switch from `read_csv` to `read_csv_chunked` or `read_csv_background`
   - Process files in manageable chunks
   - Report progress based on chunks processed

5. **Implement Proper Cancellation**
   - Allow users to cancel long-running operations
   - Clean up resources when canceled
   - Update UI appropriately after cancellation

### Expected Benefits
- UI remains responsive during file loading
- Users see visual progress indication
- Users can cancel operations if needed
- Better memory management with chunked reading
- Improved performance for large files

### Current Tasks
- [ ] Create MultiCSVLoadTask class
- [ ] Update DataManager with new signals and methods
- [ ] Add progress dialog to MainWindow
- [ ] Implement proper chunked file loading
- [ ] Add cancellation support
- [ ] Create tests for new functionality

These mockups illustrate the key UI enhancements, including:
1. Clear visual indication when views are disabled (⊗ symbol) when no data is loaded
2. Prominent call-to-action on the dashboard when empty
3. Compact header design in the Data view to maximize table space
4. Streamlined filtering and status display
5. Logical grouping of action buttons
