# Current Focus

We are currently focused on enhancing the validation system functionality and user experience, with a specific focus on improving the efficiency of managing validation lists. This follows our previous work on the configuration management system.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Enhanced validation list management with multi-entry functionality**:
   - Created a new `MultiEntryDialog` class that provides a multi-line input interface
   - Added the ability to add multiple entries at once to validation lists
   - Implemented proper handling of duplicate entries and empty lines
   - Updated UI to maintain consistent styling with the application's dark theme
   - Provided user feedback for added entries and skipped duplicates

2. Created a comprehensive test plan for the configuration system with over 35 test cases across 7 categories:
   - Settings Persistence
   - Configuration Export/Import
   - Reset Functionality
   - Error Handling
   - Settings Synchronization
   - ValidationService Integration
   - ConfigManager API

3. Implemented detailed unit tests for ConfigManager enhancements:
   - Boolean value handling with extensive parametrized tests
   - Error recovery for corrupted or missing config files
   - Configuration migration from older formats
   - Performance testing with large configurations

4. Enhanced ConfigManager.get_bool() method to support additional boolean formats:
   - Added support for 'Y'/'N' formats
   - Improved error handling for invalid values
   - Fixed case-insensitive comparison for boolean strings

5. Implemented ValidationService integration tests:
   - Created test_validation_service_config_integration.py
   - Tested initialization from configuration
   - Tested preference updates propagation
   - Tested signal emissions on preference changes
   - Tested case sensitivity and auto-save behaviors
   - Created a dedicated script for running these tests

## Current Work Focus

We're currently working on enhancing the user experience in the validation system, particularly focusing on:

1. **Validation List Management Improvements**:
   - ✅ Added multi-entry functionality for more efficient entry management
   - Considering additional validation list management features
   - Exploring potential keyboard shortcuts for common validation operations

2. **Test Infrastructure Enhancement**: 
   - Created multiple script runners for integration, validation, and all tests
   - Fixed all integration tests for `ValidationService` and `ConfigManager`
   - Fixed all unit tests for `ConfigManager` including boolean handling, migrations, and performance tests
   - Created a comprehensive `run_all_tests.py` script with filtering and coverage options

3. **Integration Testing Focus**:
   - Successfully implemented integration tests between `ValidationService` and `ConfigManager`
   - Ensured proper configuration loading, preference updates, and validation behavior
   - Added tests for configuration resets and auto-save behavior

4. **ConfigManager Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the `get_bool()` method to properly handle 'Y' and 'y' values
   - Added proper migration support for old configuration versions
   - Improved error handling for permission errors
   - Added methods to check for option existence and to reload configuration

## Recent Changes

- **Added multi-entry functionality to validation lists**:
  - Created new `MultiEntryDialog` class for adding multiple entries at once
  - Implemented `add_multiple_entries` method in `ValidationListView`
  - Updated `ValidationTabView` to use the new functionality
  - Added the new dialog class to the views package initialization
  - Ensured consistent styling with dark theme and gold accents

- Fixed all integration tests for `ValidationService` and `ConfigManager` 
- Fixed all unit tests for `ConfigManager` including:
  - Boolean value handling (proper recognition of 'Y'/'y' as True)
  - Configuration version migration
  - Better error handling for permission errors
  - Performance testing for large configurations
- Added versatile test runners:
  - `run_integration_tests.py`: Runs only integration tests
  - `run_validation_integration_tests.py`: Runs validation service integration tests
  - `run_all_tests.py`: Comprehensive runner with options for test categories and coverage
- Added missing methods to `ConfigManager` class:
  - `has_option()`: Checks if an option exists in a section
  - `load()`: Reloads configuration from disk
  - `_perform_migrations()`: Handles upgrades from older config versions

## Current Tasks

1. **Enhancing Validation System Usability**:
   - ✅ Added multi-entry functionality for adding validation list entries
   - Testing the new functionality in real-world scenarios
   - Gathering feedback for potential additional improvements

2. **Testing the Configuration System**:
   - ✅ Created comprehensive test plan
   - ✅ Implemented unit tests for ConfigManager
   - ✅ Fixed boolean value handling in ConfigManager
   - ✅ Implemented ValidationService integration tests
   - Creating test scripts for manual testing
   - Performing manual testing according to the test plan
   - Documenting test results

3. **Addressing Non-Critical Issues**:
   - Monitoring for signal connection issues in application logs
   - Investigating Unicode encoding errors in logging system

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Evaluate potential additional validation list management improvements
2. Complete manual testing for the configuration system
3. Document validation list enhancements in the system documentation
4. Consider additional UX improvements based on user feedback
5. Explore potential performance optimizations for large validation lists

## Technical Decisions

1. **Multi-Entry Dialog Design**:
   - Used QTextEdit for multi-line input instead of QLineEdit
   - Implemented entry filtering to handle empty lines and duplicates
   - Provided clear feedback on the number of entries added vs. duplicates skipped
   - Used consistent styling with application's dark theme
   - Made dialog resizable to accommodate different entry list sizes

2. **Config System Testing Approach**:
   - Using a combination of automated unit tests and integration tests
   - Creating dedicated temporary directories for test configurations
   - Using mock objects for testing ValidationService integration
   - Implementing test scripts for reproducible manual testing

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Adding robust error recovery for corrupted configuration files
   - Implementing graceful fallback to defaults
   - Adding detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Ongoing Discussions

1. **Configuration UI Improvements**:
   - Considering adding a Config Debug view for developers
   - Evaluating the need for configuration schema versioning
   - Discussing backup/restore workflow improvements

2. **Validation System Extensions**:
   - Considering adding support for regex patterns in validation lists
   - Evaluating performance optimizations for large validation lists
   - Discussing potential for fuzzy matching in validation
